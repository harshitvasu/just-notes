 The records of the East India Company provide a detailed account of trading conditions during the period 1600–1857. When the British crown took over the administration, it also kept a large variety and volume of official records. These records help historians to trace every important development stage-by-stage an

ommercial, judicial, education, etc.—and a separate set of records was kept for each of these branches or departments. With the appointment of James Rennell as the first Surveyor General of Bengal in 1767, the Survey of India began to scientifically map the unknown regions of the country and its bordering lands. The records of the Survey of India as well as the journals and memoirs of the surveyors pr

are mentioned in the educational records of the central archives. The papers bearing on the emergence of the nationalist movement were part of the public series of the home department records, but in 1907, a new series of records—Home Political—was started to deal exclusively with political and communal issues. The records of the Reforms Office are very useful for an analytical study of the constituti

onal developments from 1920 to 1937. Archives of the State Governments The source material in the state archives comprise the records of: (i) the former British Indian provinces; (ii) the erstwhile princely states which were incorporat

ed in the Indian Union after 1947; and (iii) the foreign administrations other than those of the British. Apart from these, the records of those Indian powers which were taken over by the British, for instance, the archives of the Ki

ngdom of Lahore (popularly known as Khalsa Darbar records from 1800 to 1849), are important source material. Another important collection of  

 Rajasthan, viz., Jaipur, Bikaner, Jodhpur, Udaipur, etc., the archives of these states, now housed in the Rajasthan State Archives at Bikaner, are valuable. Similarly, the history of Dogra rule from 1846 in Jammu and Kashmir can be studied in the valuable collection of state papers housed at Jammu. The other significant archives of the princely states are those of Gwalior, Indore, Bhopal, and Rewa, a

 and Cochin in Kerala; Mysore in Karnataka; and Kolhapur in Maharashtra. Archives of Three Presidencies The early records of Fort Williams (Bengal Presidency) were lost during the sack of Calcutta in 1756, but the archives of the Bengal presidency after the British victory at Plassey have survived more or less in a complete series, which are partly available in the National Archives of India and partl

y in the State Archives of West Bengal. The records of the Madras Presidency begin from AD 1670 and include records of the Governor and Council of Fort St. George. In these records, there is plenty of information bearing on the rise of the English East India Company as a political power in the 

, are extremely useful in studying the history of Western India—Maharashtra, Gujarat, Sindh, and the Kannada-speaking districts of the erstwhile Bombay Presidency which were incorporated in Mysore in 1956. Archives of Other European Powers The archives related to the Portuguese preserved in Goa, mainly belonging to the period from 1700 to 1900, are  

efore they relinquished these settlements. The archives of the Danish possessions were also transferred to Copenhagen when the Danes sold Tranquebar and Serampore to the English East India Company in 1845. The remaining Danish records, mainly relating to Tranquebar (1777–1845), are now housed in the Madras Record Office. Judicial Records Housed in the Madras Record Office, the archives of the Mayor’s 

Court at Fort St. George, beginning from AD 1689, are the earliest available judicial archives. The pre-Plassey records of the Mayor’s Court at Fort Williams have been lost, but those for the years 1757–73 are kept in the record room of the Calcutta High Court, along with the archives of the Supreme Court of Bengal (1774–1861). Similarly, the records of the Mayor’s Court at Bombay established in 172

Famous non-British travellers who wrote about India include Victor Jacquemont (Letters from India: Describing a Journey in the British Dominions of India, Tibet, Lahore, and Cashmere During the Years 1828, 1829, 1830 1831.), Baron Charles (Travels in Kashmir and the Punjab), and William Moorcroft. These travel accounts are indispensable and generally reliable sources for constructing the history of mo

ia. The first attempts to publish newspapers in India were made by the disgruntled employees of the English East India Company who sought to expose the malpractices of private trade. For instance, in 1776, William Bolts, being censured by the Court of Directors for private trading, resigned from the Company and announced his intention to publish a newspaper. The official response to Bolts’ scheme was 

strong and his plan ended before materialising. In 1780, James Augustus Hickey published the first newspaper in India entitled The Bengal Gazette or Calcutta General Advertiser. Hickey’s press was seized within two years, owing to his outspoken criticism 

of government officials. Afterwards, many publications appeared such as The Calcutta Gazette (1784), The Madras Courier (1788), and The Bombay Herald (1789). The newspapers and journals of the early period primarily aimed at catering to the intellectual entertainment of the Europeans and Anglo-Indians. From the second half of the 19th century, many powe

 one-third of the founding fathers of the Indian National Congress in 1885 were journalists. Some of their publications were: The Hindu and Swadesamitran under the editorship of G. Subramaniya Iyer; Kesari and Mahratta under Bal Gangadhar Tilak; Bengalee under Surendranath 

attopadhyay), and Ghadar (San Francisco, Lala Hardayal)— to infuse a feeling of nationalism among Indians living abroad. Newspapers depict almost all aspects of life in colonial India from around the 1870s onwards. From the 1920s onwards, newspapers tracked the major events during the freedom struggle. However, newspaper accounts cannot be seen as unprejudiced or completely objective. The accounts tha

ropean contact was the literary genre of the novel which emerged in the latter half of the 19th century. The first important writer of that period was the Bengali novelist, Bankim Chandra Chatterjee (1838-94). His novels are mostly historical, the best known among them being Anandamath (1882), noted for its powerful lyric ‘Vandemataram’ and depiction of the Sanyasi Revolt (1760s). His last novel Rajas

imha can be called the grand finale to his remarkable career. Iccharam Suryaram Desai (1853–1912) was a fine scholar of medieval Gujarati literary history. His first novel Hind ane Britannia was one of the earliest Indian novels with political overtones. Tamil writers like Girija Devi and Ramati

rthammal, who wrote Mohana Rajani (1931) and Dasikalin Mosavalai (1936) respectively, also made the novel an effective vehicle of social experience. G.V. Krishna Rao’s Keelubommalu (The Puppets, 1956) in Telugu was concerned with the moral aspects and behaviour of the rural people. Vaikom Muhammad Basheer (1910– 1994) was one of the eminent writers in Malayalam whose famous novel Balyakalasakhi (

The Childhood Friends, 1944) was a tragic tale of love. Similarly, Thakazhi Sivasankara Pillai became prominent for his two extremely well-written works in Malayalam, Tottiyude Makan (Son of a Scavenger, 1948) and Chemmeen (Shr

imps, 1956). Despite having different educational backgrounds and social outlooks, all these writers shared a strong sense of realism and deep interest in the life of the marginalised and oppressed sections of 

me. Trades, festivals, dances, and the attire of people are visible in these works. Company paintings continued to be popular in the 19th century until the introduction of photography in India in the 1840s. The pictorial images produced by the British and Indians—paintings, pencil drawings, etchings, posters, cartoons, and bazaar prints—are especially important records of the great revolt of 1857. The

o provoke a range of different emotions and reactions. Some of them commemorate the British heroes who saved the English and repressed the rebels. Relief of Lucknow, painted by Thomas Jones Barker in 1859, is one such example. Another painting of this period, In Memoriam by Joseph Noel Paton, recorded in painting two years of the revolt of 1857. One can see English women and children huddled in a circ

ure of colonial rule. This approach developed as a response to and in confrontation with the colonial approach. It should be noted that the nationalist historians of modern India did not exist before 1947. Before 1947, nationalist historiography mainly dealt with the ancient and medieval periods of Indian history. However, in the last quarter of the 19th century, a detailed and scientific critique of 

Joshi, R.C. Dutt, K.T. Telang, G.K. Gokhale, and D.E. Wacha. (Sakharam Ganesh Deuskar, a close associate of Sri Aurobindo, popularised the ideas of Naoroji and Ranade in his Desher Katha published in 1904 in Bengali.) The only accounts of the national movement was by nationalist leaders (not historians) such as R.G. Pradhan, A.C. Mazumdar, J.L. Nehru, and Pattabhi Sitaramayya. R.C. Majumdar and Tara C

two classic books—Rajni Palme Dutt’s India Today and A.R. Desai’s Social Background of Indian Nationalism. Originally written for the famous Left Book Club in England, India Today, first published in 1940 in England, was later published in India in 1947. A.R. Desai’s Social Background of Indian Nationalism, was first published in 1948. Unlike the imperialist/colonial approach, the Marxist historians c

traces the growth of the national movement in five phases, each phase based on particular social classes which supported and sustained it. Subaltern Approach This school of thought began in the early 1980s under the editorship of Ranajit Guha, as a critique of the existing historiography, which was faulted for ignoring the voice of the people. Right from the beginning, subaltern historiography took th

Britain. The proponents of this school of thought are Patrick O’Brian, Hopkins, and Cain. Feminist Approach The shift in terms of the writing of women’s history began with the women’s movement of the 1970s which provided the context and impetus for the emergence of women’s studies in India. Very soon, women’s history broadened and assumed the more complex shape of gender history. In the early years, t

 resources has been focused on, in the analysis of how progressive laws shaped gender relations. In the colonial period, two works based upon the women’s question in India—The High Caste Hindu Woman (1887) by Pandita Ramabai, and Mother India (1927) by Katherine Mayo—attracted international attention. Summary Different Approaches Colonial Approach is influenced by the colonial ideology of domination. 

he Europeans and India declined, and, with that, the easy accessibility to the Indian commodities like spices, calicoes, silk, and various precious stones that were greatly in demand was affected. In 1453, Constantinople fell to the Ottoman Turks, who were on the ascendant. Merchandise from India went to the European markets through Arab Muslim intermediaries. The Red Sea trade route was a state monop

gator’; also, he was keen to find a way to circumvent the Muslim domination of the eastern Mediterranean and all the routes that connected India to Europe. Pope Nicholas V gave Prince Henry a bull in 1454, conferring on him the right to navigate the “sea to the distant shores of the Orient”, more specifically “as far as India” in an attempt to fight Islamic influence and spread the Christian faith. Ho

wever, Prince Henry died before his dream could become a reality. In 1497, under the Treaty of Tordesillas (1494), the rulers of Portugal and Spain divided the non-Christian world between them by an imaginary line in the Atlantic, some 1,300 miles west of the Cape Verde Islands. Under the treaty, Portugal could

aim and occupy everything to the east of the line while Spain could claim everything to the west. The situation was thus prepared for the Portuguese incursions into the waters around India. It was in 1487 that the Portuguese navigator, Bartholomew Dias, rounded the Cape of Good Hope in Africa and sailed up the eastern coast; he was well convinced that the long-sought-after sea route to India had been 

found. But it was only ten years later that an expedition of Portuguese ships set out for India (in 1497) and arrived in India in slightly less than 11 months’ time, in May 1498. From Trading to Ruling Vasco Da Gama The arrival of three ships under Vasco Da Gama, led by a Gujarati pilot named Abdul Majid, at Calicut in May 1498 profoundly affected the course of Indian histor

ere tempted to come to India and trade directly. A voyage was undertaken by Pedro Alvarez Cabral to trade for spices; he negotiated and established a factory at Calicut, where he arrived in September 1500. There was an incident of conflict when the Portuguese factory at Calicut was attacked by the locals, resulting in the death of several Portuguese. In retaliation, Cabral seized a number of Arab merc

nd burning the ships. Calicut was bombarded by Cabral. Later, Cabral succeeded in making advantageous treaties with the local rulers of Cochin and Cannanore. Vasco da Gama once again came to India in 1501. The Zamorin declined to exclude the Arab merchants in favour of the Portuguese when Vasco Da Gama combined commercial greed with ferocious hostility and wreaked vengeance on Arab shipping wherever h

trade centres of the Portuguese. Gradually, under the pretext of protecting the factories and their trading activities, the Portuguese got permission to fortify these centres. Francisco De Almeida In 1505, the King of Portugal appointed a governor in India for a three-year term and equipped the incumbent with sufficient force to protect the Portuguese interests.

He was also advised to build fortresses at Anjadiva, Cochin, View The landing of Vasco da Gama at Calicut in 1498 ... is generally regarded as the beginning of a new era in world history, especially in the relationship between Asia and Europe. Although Asia and Europe had been in commercial relations with each o

couraged by the merchants of Venice, whose lucrative commerce was now at risk due to the Portuguese interference, the Egyptians raised a fleet in the Red Sea to stop the advance of the Portuguese. In 1507, the Portuguese squadron was defeated in a naval battle off Diu by the combined Egyptian and Gujarat navies, and Almeida’s son was killed. Next year, Almeida avenged his defeat by totally crushing th

s in the region. The nonavailability of timber in the Gulf and Red Sea regions for ship-building also helped the Portuguese in their objectives. Albuquerque acquired Goa from the Sultan of Bijapur in 1510 with ease; the principal port of the Sultan of Bijapur became “the first bit of Indian territory to be under the Europeans since the time of Alexander the Great”. An interesting feature of his rule w

Most of such Portuguese came to look upon their new settlements, rather than Portugal, as home. Nino da Cunha Nino da Cunha assumed office of the governor of Portuguese interests in India in November 1529 and almost one year later shifted the headquarters of the Portuguese government in India from Cochin to Goa. Bahadur Shah of Gujarat, during his conflict with the Mughal emperor Humayun, secured help

 from the Portuguese by ceding to them in 1534 the island of Bassein with its dependencies and revenues. He also promised them a base in Diu. However, Bahadur Shah’s relations with the Portuguese became sour when Humayun withdrew from Gujarat in 

1536. Since the inhabitants of the town started fighting with the Portuguese, Bahadur Shah wanted to raise a wall of partition. Opposing this, the Portuguese started negotiations, in the course of which t

he ruler of Gujarat was invited to a Portuguese ship and killed in 1537. Da Cunha also attempted to increase Portuguese influence in Bengal by settling many Portuguese nationals there with Hooghly as their headquarters. View Bitter persecution of Muslims was one serious 

 Favourable Conditions for Portuguese In India, excepting Gujarat, which was ruled by the powerful Mahmud Begarha (or Begada) from 1458 to 1511, the northern part was much divided among many small powers. In the Deccan, the Bahmani Kingdom was breaking up into smaller kingdoms. None of the powers had a navy worth its name, nor did they think

ans, between the Deccanis and the Mughals, and between the Mughals and the Marathas. Interestingly, the Portuguese, the first Europeans to come to India, were also the last to leave this land. It was 1961 before the Government of India recaptured Goa, Daman and Diu from them. Portuguese Administration in India The head of the administration was the viceroy who served for three years, with his secretar

so persecuted. But, in spite of this intolerant behaviour, the Jesuits made a good impression at the court of Akbar, mainly due to the Mughal emperor’s interest in questions of theology. In September 1579, Akbar forwarded a letter to the authorities at Goa, requesting them to send two learned priests. The Church authorities in Goa eagerly accepted the invitation, seeing in it a chance to convert the e

mperor to Christianity, and with him his court and the people. Jesuit fathers, Rodolfo Aquaviva and Antonio Monserrate, were selected for the purpose. When they reached Fatehpur Sikri on February 28, 1580, they were received with honour.  

 Aquaviva and Monserrate went back in 1583, belying the hopes the Portuguese entertained of Akbar’s conversion to the Christian faith. The second mission called by Akbar in 1590 also ended on a similar note in 1592. The third mission, again invited by Akbar, arrived in 1595 at Lahore (where the court was then residing) and continued as a sort of permanent institution, thereb

Gradually, however, his temporary estrangement from the Jesuits ended, and in 1606, he renewed his favours to them. The elegant and spacious church at Lahore was allowed to be retained by them along with the collegium or the priests’ residence. In 1608, a number of baptisms were ca

 Christian fold. However, these hopes were belied. Moreover, arrogant actions on the part of the Portuguese viceroys created a rift with the Mughal emperor. Portuguese Lose Favour with the Mughals In 1608, Captain William Hawkins with his ship Hector reached Surat. He brought with him a letter from James I, King of England, to the Mughal court of Jahangir, requesting permission to do business in India

orities did their best to prevent Hawkins from reaching the Mughal court, but they did not succeed. Jahangir accepted the gifts Hawkins brought for him and gave Hawkins a very favourable reception in 1609. As Hawkins knew the Turki language well, he conversed with the emperor in that language without the aid of an interpreter. Pleased with  

gotiations, a truce was established between the Portuguese and the Mughal emperor. The Portuguese stopped the English ships from entering the port of Surat. A baffled Hawkins left the Mughal court in 1611, unable to counter the Portuguese intrigues or check the vacillating Mughal policies. However, in November 1612, the English ship Dragon under Captain Best along with a little ship, the Osiander, suc

eet. Jahangir, who had no navy worth its name, learnt of the English success and was greatly impressed. The Portuguese acts of piracy also resulted in conflict with the imperial Mughal government. In 1613, the Portuguese offended Jahangir by capturing Mughal ships, imprisoning many Muslims, and plundering the cargoes. An enraged Jahangir ordered Muqarrab Khan, who was then in charge of Surat, to obtai

al India to Christianity, a hope that the Portuguese held because of the welcome accorded to them and their religion by Akbar and Jahangir. Capture of Hooghly On the basis of an imperial farman circa 1579, the Portuguese had settled down on a river bank which was a short distance from Satgaon in Bengal to carry on their trading activities. Over the years, they strengthened their position by constructi

ave trade by purchasing or seizing Hindu and Muslim children, whom they brought up as Christians. In the course of their nefarious activities, they seized two slave girls of Mumtaz Mahal. On June 24, 1632, the Mughal siege of Hooghly began, ending in its capture three months later. Shah Jahan ordered the Bengal governor Qasim Khan to take action against the Portuguese. The siege of Hooghly finally led

 soon it did not matter in whose possession it was. The spice trade came under the control of the Dutch, and Goa was superseded by Brazil as the economic centre of the overseas empire of Portugal. In 1683, after two naval assaults, the Marathas invaded Goa. Significance of the Portuguese Most historians have observed that the coming of the Portuguese not only initiated what might be called the Europea

, and the ‘artillery of the stirrup’. However, an important military contribution made by the Portuguese onshore was the system of drilling groups of infantry, on the Spanish model, introduced in the 1630s as a counter to Dutch pressure. The practice was adopted first by the French and English, and later taken up by the Marathas and Sikhs, and such armies of sepoys became new tools of empire in India.

generally simple in their architectural plan. The Dutch Commercial enterprise led the Dutch to undertake voyages to the East. Cornelis de Houtman was the first Dutchman to reach Sumatra and Bantam in 1596. In 1602, the States- General of the Netherlands amalgamated many trading companies into the East India Company of the Netherlands. This company was also empowered to carry on war, to conclude treati

es, to take possession of territory, and to erect fortresses. Dutch Settlements After their arrival in India, the Dutch founded their first factory in Masulipatnam (in Andhra) in 1605. They went on to establish trading centres in different parts of India and thus  

m near Madras (Chennai) from the Portuguese and made it their main stronghold in South India. The Dutch established factories on the Coromandel coast, in Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Bengal, and Bihar. In 1609, they opened a factory in Pulicat, north of Madras. Their other principal factories in India were at Surat (1616), Bimlipatam (1641), Karaikal (1645), Chinsura (1653), Baranagar, Kasimbazar (near Mur

shidabad), Balasore, Patna, Nagapatam (1658), and Cochin (1663). Participating in the redistributive or carrying trade, they took to the islands of the Far East various articles and merchandise from India. They carried indigo manufactured in the Yamuna valley an

to bloody warfare. The climax of the enmity between the Dutch and the English in the East was reached at Amboyna (a place in present-day Indonesia, which the Dutch had captured from the Portuguese in 1605) where they massacred ten Englishmen and nine Japanese in 1623. This incident further intensified the rivalry between the two European companies. After prolonged warfare, both the parties came to a c

ompromise in 1667 by which the British agreed to withdraw all their claims on Indonesia, and the Dutch retired from India to concentrate on their more profitable trade in Indonesia. They monopolised the trade in black

The retaliation by the English resulted in the defeat of the Dutch, in the Battle of Hooghly (November 1759), which dealt a crushing blow to Dutch ambitions in India. The Dutch were not much interested in empire building in India; their concerns were trade. In any case, their main commercial interest lay i

n the Spice Islands of Indonesia from where they earned a huge profit through business. The English Charter of Queen Elizabeth I Francis Drake’s voyage around the world in 1580 and the English victory over the Spanish Armada in 1588 generated a new sense of enterprise in the British, encouraging sailors to venture out to the East. As the knowledge grew of the high profits e

arned by the Portuguese in Eastern trade, English traders too wanted a share. So, in 1599, a group of English merchants calling themselves the ‘Merchant Adventurers’ formed a company. On December 31, 1600, Queen Elizabeth I issued a charter with rights of exclusive trading to the company named the ‘Governor and Company of Merchants of London trading into the East Indies’. Initially, a monopoly of 15 y

 1609 was extended indefinitely by a fresh charter. As the Dutch were already concentrating more on the East Indies, the English turned to India in search of textiles and other commodities of trade. Progre

ss of the English Company Foothold in West and South Captain Hawkins arrived in the court of Jahangir in April 1609 itself. But the mission to establish a factory at Surat did not succeed due to opposition from the Portuguese, and Hawkins left Agra in November 1611. In 1611, the English had started trading at Masu

lipatnam on the south-eastern coast of India and later established a factory there in 1616. It was in 1612 that Captain Thomas Best defeated the Portuguese in the sea off Surat; an impressed Jahangir granted permission to the English in early 1613 to establish a factory at Surat under Thomas Aldworth. In 

1615, Sir Thomas Roe came as an accredited ambassador of James I to the court of Jahangir, staying on there till February 1619. Though he was unsuccessful in concluding a commercial treaty with the Mughal emperor, he was able to secure a number of privileges, including permission to set up factories at Agra, Ahmedabad, and B

 changing situation helped them and turned things in their favour. Bombay had been gifted to King Charles II by the King of Portugal as dowry when Charles married the Portuguese princess Catherine in 1662. Bombay was given over to the East India Company on an annual payment of 10 pounds only in 1668. Later, Bombay was made the headquarters by shifting the seat of the Western Presidency from Surat to B

ombay in 1687. So, there was tacit peace between the English and the Portuguese now. There was also an Anglo-Dutch compromise as mentioned earlier by which the Dutch agreed not to interfere with the English compan

 The English company’s position was improved by the ‘Golden Farman’ issued to them by the Sultan of Golconda in 1632. On a payment of 500 pagodas a year, they earned the privilege of trading freely in the ports of Golconda. A member of the Masulipatnam council, the British merchant Francis Day in 1639 received from

 the English settlements in south India. Thereafter, the English extended their trading activities to the east and started factories at Hariharpur in the Mahanadi delta and at Balasore (in Odisha) in 1633. Foothold in Bengal Bengal was then a large and rich province in India, advanced in trade and commerce. Commercial and political control over Bengal naturally appeared an attractive proposition to th

e profit-seeking English merchants. Bengal was also an important province of the Mughal empire. Shah Shuja, the subahdar (or governor) of Bengal in 1651, allowed the English to trade in Bengal in return for an annual payment of Rs 3,000, in lieu of all duties. Factories in Bengal were started at Hooghly (1651) and other places like Kasimbazar, Patna,

ettlement at Hooghly so that force could be used if necessary. William Hedges, the first agent and governor of the Company in Bengal, appealed to Shaista Khan, the Mughal governor of Bengal in August 1682, for redressal of the grievance. As nothing came out of the appeal, hostilities broke out between the English and the Mughals. Four years later, Hooghly was sacked by the imperial Mughals in October 

1686. The English retaliated by capturing the imperial forts at Thana (modern Garden Reach), raiding Hijli in east Midnapur and storming the Mughal fortifications at  

fter the Mughal raid on Hooghly, Job Charnock, a company agent, started negotiations with the Mughals so as to return to a place called Sutanuti. Charnock signed a treaty with the Mughals in February 1690, and returned to Sutanuti in August 1690. Thus, an English factory was established on February 10, 1691, the day an imperial farman was issued, permitting the English to “continue contentedly their t

,000 a year in lieu of all dues. A zamindar in Bardhaman district, Sobha Singh, rebelled, subsequently giving the English the pretext they were looking for, to fortify their settlement at Sutanuti in 1696. In 1698, the English succeeded in getting the permission to buy the zamindari of the three villages of Sutanuti, Gobindapur, and Kalikata (Kalighat) from their owners on payment of Rs 1,200. The for

tified settlement was named Fort William in the year 1700 when it also became the seat of the eastern presidency (Calcutta) with Sir Charles Eyre as its first president. Farrukhsiyar’s Farmans In 1715, an English mission led by John Surman to the court of the Mughal emperor Farrukhsiyar secured three famous farmans, giving the Company many valuable privileges in Bengal, Gujarat and Hyderabad.

Merging of Two English Companies After the English revolution of 1688, the Whigs, with their enhanced influence, opposed the monopoly of the East India Company. Thus, a rival company was formed which deputed Sir William Norris as its ambassador to the court of Aurangze

b (January 1701–April 1702) to gain trading privileges for itself. The new company, however, proved a failure. Under pressure from the Crown and the Parliament, the two companies were amalgamated in 1708 under the title of ‘United Company of Merchants of England Trading to the East Indies’. This was the East India Company—from 1708 to 1873—which was to establish British political power in India. The 

 to come to India with the purpose of trade. During the reign of Louis XIV, the king’s famous minister Colbert laid the foundation of the Compagnie des Indes Orientales (French East India Company) in 1664, in which the king also took a deep interest. The Compagnie des Indes Orientales was granted a 50-year monopoly on French trade in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. The French king also granted the comp

d of Madagascar, as well as any other territories it could conquer. The Company spent a lot of its money and resources in trying to revive the colonies of Madagascar but without any success. Then, in 1667, Francois Caron headed an expedition to India, setting up a factory in Surat. Mercara, a Persian who accompanied Caron, founded another French factory in Masulipatnam in 1669 after obtaining a patent

 from the Sultan of Golconda. In 1673, the  

 French obtained permission from Shaista Khan, the Mughal subahdar of Bengal, to establish a township at Chandernagore near Calcutta. Pondicherry—Nerve Centre of French Power in India In 1673, Sher Khan Lodi, the governor of Valikondapuram (under the Bijapur Sultan), granted Francois Martin, the director of the Masulipatnam factory, a site for a settlement. Pondicherry was founded in 1674

India also, particularly in the coastal regions. Mahe, Karaikal, Balasore, and Qasim Bazar were a few important trading centres of the French East India Company. After taking charge of Pondicherry in 1674, Francois Martin developed it as a place of importance. It was, indeed, the stronghold of the French in India. Early Setbacks to the French East India Company The French position in India was badly a

ffected with the outbreak of war between the Dutch and the French. Bolstered by their alliance with the English since the Revolution of 1688, the Dutch captured Pondicherry in 1693. Although the Treaty of Ryswick concluded in September 1697 restored Pondicherry to the French, the Dutch garrison held on to it for two more years. Once again, under Francois Martin’s able guidance,

Consequent to this, they had to abandon their factories at Surat, Masulipatnam, and Bantam in the early 18th century. The French in India had another setback when Francois Martin died on December 31, 1706. Reorganisation of the French Company In 1720, the French company was reorganised as the ‘Perpetual Company of the Indies’ which revived its strength. This was  

 further enhanced by the stewardship of two active and wise governors, Lenoir and Dumas, between 1720 and 1742. Further, the French India was backed by the French possession of Mauritius and Reunion in the southern Indian Ocean. The Anglo-French Struggle for Supremacy: the Carnatic Wars Background of Rivalry 

onclusion of the Seven Years’ War. Specifically in India, the rivalry, in the form of three Carnatic wars, decided once for all that the English and not the French were to become masters of India. In 1740, the political situation in south India was uncertain and confused. Nizam Asaf Jah of Hyderabad was old and fully engaged in battling the Marathas in the western Deccan while his subordinates were sp

ism and the English adventurers got their plans ready. Also, there was the Maratha kingdom of Tanjore, providing the Peshwa of Pune an excuse for interference whenever he pleased. First Carnatic War (1740–48) Background Carnatic was the name given by the Europeans to the Coromandel Coast and its hinterland. The First Carnatic War was an extension of the Anglo-French War  

atively weaker position in India, did not favour an extension of hostilities to India, the English navy under Barnet seized some French ships to provoke France. France retaliated by seizing Madras in 1746 with the help of the fleet from Mauritius, the Isle of France, under Admiral La Bourdonnais, the French governor of Mauritius. Thus began the first Carnatic War. Result The First Carnatic War ended i

n 1748 when the Treaty of Aix-La Chapelle was signed, bringing the Austrian War of Succession to a conclusion. Under the terms of this treaty, Madras was handed back to the English, and the French, in turn,

disciplined army could easily defeat a much larger Indian army. Further, this war adequately brought out the importance of naval force in the Anglo-French conflict in the Deccan. Second Carnatic War (1749–54) Background The background for the Second Carnatic War was provided by rivalry in India. Dupleix, the French governor who had successfully led the French forces in the First Carnatic War, sought t

ia by interfering in local dynastic disputes to defeat the English. Immediate Cause The opportunity was provided by the death of Nizam-ul-Mulk, the founder of the independent kingdom of Hyderabad, in 1748, and the release of Chanda Sahib, the son-in-law of Dost Ali, the Nawab of Carnatic,  

lish sided with Nasir Jang and Anwaruddin. Course of the War The combined armies of Muzaffar Jang, Chanda Sahib, and the French defeated and killed Anwaruddin at the Battle of Ambur (near Vellore) in 1749. Muzaffar Jang became the subahdar of Deccan, and Dupleix was appointed governor of all the Mughal territories to the south of the River Krishna. A French army under Bussy was stationed at Hyderabad 

sted a sudden raid on Arcot, the capital of the Carnatic, so as to relieve the pressure on Trichinopoly. He reasoned that in such an event Chanda Sahib would rush to save his capital. Thus, in August 1751, with only a force of 210 men, Robert Clive attacked and captured Arcot. As expected, Chanda Sahib hastened to his capital, taking a force of 4,000 men from Trichinopoly, but failed to get back the f

and Stringer Lawrence. Trichinopoly was first relieved of its siege, while General Law of France with Chanda Sahib remained cooped up in the island of Srirangam. They were forced to surrender in June 1752 when Muhammad Ali executed Chanda Sahib, the British failing to interfere.  

 Rise and Fall of Dupleix in India Joseph Francis Dupleix, born in 1697, was the son of a wealthy Farmer-General of Taxes and Director-General of the Company of the Indies. He got a high post at Pondicherry in 1720, allegedly on the basis of influence of his father. At P

ondicherry, he made a lot of money by private trade, which was then permitted to servants of the French company. In December 1726, he was suspended owing to drastic change in the constitution of the French company and some confusions arising out of that. In 1730, Dupleix won his case, and was appointed as governor of Chandernag

ore as compensation. In 1741, he was appointed as the Director-General of French colonies in India. Later, he was conferred the title of Nawab by the Mughal emperor and the subahdar of Deccan, Muzzaffar Jang. According to histor

ians, Dupleix possessed qualities of an administrator, a diplomat, and a leader besides having political insight with a broad vision. Dupleix in the Role of Administrator In 1741, Dupleix became the Governor, General of Pondicherry. He found Pondicherry facing several problems—Maratha invasion, famine, uncultivated land, and chaotic conditions in the Carnatic. Apart from thes

 not give Madras to the nawab and even defeated him at St. Thome (1746). Dupleix convinced Admiral La Bourdonnais to break promises made to the English, citing examples from history that promises made under certain circumstances were never binding. Further, he said that

 was, in fact, the originator of the practice of subsidiary alliance in India. He placed a French army at Hyderabad at the expense of the subahdar. Why Dupleix Failed in India Dupleix was recalled in 1754 due to the initial defeat of the French army in the Second Carnatic War and the heavy cost incurred by the company due to Dupleix’s political decisions. Many historians have called the recall of Dupl

er. (iii) Dupleix was not a man of action: he planned a campaign, directed his lieutenants, but never led an army in the battlefield like Lawrence or Clive. The French failed to capture Trichinopoly (1752–53) because the schemes thought out by Dupleix could not be turned into action by his commanders. Result The French authorities, annoyed at the heavy financial losses that Dupleix’s policy involved, 

decided to recall him in 1754. Godeheu succeeded Dupleix as the French governor general in India. Godeheu adopted a policy of negotiations with the English and concluded a treaty with them. The English and the French agreed not t

 success; rather Indian authority itself was becoming dependent on European support. Muhammad Ali in the Carnatic and Salabat Jang in Hyderabad became clients rather than patrons. Third Carnatic War (1758–63) Background In Europe, when Austria wanted to recover Silesia in 1756, the Seven Years’ War (1756–63) started. Britain and France were once again on opposite sides. Course of War in India In 1758,

Dodwell (The Cambridge History of India, Vol V) Battle of Wandiwash The decisive battle of the Third Carnatic War was won by the English on January 22, 1760 at Wandiwash (or Vandavasi) in Tamil Nadu. General Eyre Coote of the English totally routed the French army under Count Thomas Arthur de Lally and took Bussy as prisoner. Pondicherry was gallantly de

fended by Lally for eight months before he surrendered on January 16, 1761. With the loss of Jinji and Mahe, the French power in India was reduced to its lowest. Lally, after being taken as prisoner of war at London, returned to France where he was imprisoned and executed i

n 1766. Result and Significance The Third Carnatic War proved decisive. Although the Treaty of Peace of Paris (1763) restored to the French their factories in India, the French political influence disappeared after the war. Thereafter, the French, like their Portuguese and Dutch counterparts in India, confined the

mselves to their small enclaves and to commerce. The English became the supreme European power in the Indian subcontinent, since the Dutch had already been defeated in the Battle of Bidara in 1759. The Battle of Plassey, in 1757, is usually regarded by historians as the decisive event that brought about ultimate British rule over India. However, one cannot quite ignore the view that the true t

urning point for control of the subcontinent was the victory of British forces over the French forces at Wandiwash in 1760. The victory at Wandiwash left the English East India Company with no European rival in India.  

 The Danes The Danish East India Company was established in 1616, and in 1620, they founded a factory at Tranquebar near Tanjore, on the eastern coast of India. Their principal settlement was at Serampore near Calcutta. The Danish factories, which were not important at any tim

e, were sold to the British government in 1845. The Danes are better known for their missionary activities than for commerce. Why the English Succeeded against Other European Powers Of all the European nations who came as traders to India after n

 very little interest in promoting the prosperity of the company, because the State guaranteed a dividend to the shareholders. The lack of public interest could be inferred from the fact that between 1725 and 1765, there was no meeting of the shareholders and the company was simply managed as a department of the State. Naval Superiority The Royal Navy of Britain was not only the largest, it was the mo

ogical developments equipped the military well. All this combined to enable smaller groups of English fighters defeat larger armies. Stable Government With the exception of the Glorious Revolution of 1688, Britain witnessed stable government with efficient monarchs.  

 Other European nations like France witnessed violent revolution in 1789 and afterwards the Napoleonic Wars. Napoleon’s defeat in 1815 significantly weakened France’s position, and from then on it was forced to side with Britain. The Italians got united as a nation as late in 1861. The Dutch and Spain were also involved in the 80-ye

ars war in the 17th century, which weakened Portuguese imperialism. The Dutch East India Company, affected by bankruptcy in 1800 coupled with the revolution in 1830, was forced to sell its possessions to Britain and quit Asia. Lesser Zeal for Religion Britain was less zealous about religion and less interested in spreading Christianity, as compared to Spain, Por

ting rival countries like France and Spain. Britain was thus enabled to spend much more on its military than its rivals. Britain’s rival France could not match the expenditure of the English; between 1694 and 1812, first under the monarchs, then under the revolutionary governments, and finally under Napoleon Bonaparte, France simply went bankrupt with its outdated ways of raising money.

 Association later called the Assada company, formed by Sir William Courteen, was given license to trade by Charles I. In 1657, both the companies merged. In 1698, another rival company emerged. In 1702, the rivalry between the old and the new company came to an end, but their final amalgamation took place in 1708 under the title ‘The United Company of Merchants of England Trading to the East Indies

’, after the arbitration of the Earl of Godolphin. This Company ruled in India till 1858. The French Foundation In 1664, Colbert, a minister of Louis XIV, laid the foundations of Compagnie des Indes Orientales. Settlements in India Pondicherry, developed as headquarters, was granted to Francois Martin, the director of

 Masulipatnam factory, by Valikondapuram governor Sher Khan Lodi in 1673. Finally incorporated into the Indian Union in 1954. Anglo-French Rivalry in India The Anglo-French rivalry in India coincided with the wars between the English and French in Europe. Causes ● For protection and expansion of commercial interests. ● Pol

itical developments in southern India and Europe provided pretexts to contest their claims which culminated in three Carnatic wars. First Carnatic War (1740–48) It was an extension of the Anglo-French rivalry in Europe and ended in 1748 with the Treaty of Aix-La Chapelle. Second Carnatic War (1749–54) Although inconclusive, it undermined the French power

 in South India vis-à-vis the English. Third Carnatic War (1758–63) ● A decisive war, known for the Battle of Wandiwash (1760–61) ● An echo of the Anglo-French struggle in Europe ● By the Treaty of Paris (1763), the French were allowed to use Indian settlements for commercial purposes only and fortification of settlements w

n the Eve of British Conquest The first half of the 18th century saw the decline of the mighty Mughals, who had been the envy of their contemporaries for almost two centuries. The reign of Aurangzeb (1658–1707) proved to signify the beginning of the end of Mughal rule in India. It is argued that Aurangzeb’s misguided policies weakened the stability of the state and the decline gained momentum after hi

s death due to wars of succession and weak rulers. Though Muhammad Shah ruled for a long spell of 29 years (1719–48), a revival of the imperial fortunes did not take place as he was an incompetent ruler. Muhammad Shah’s reign witnessed the establishment of the independent states of Hyderabad, Bengal, Awadh, and

 Nadir Shah, the Persian emperor, attacked India in 1738–39, conquered Lahore, and defeated the Mughal army at Karnal on February 13, 1739. Later, Muhammad Shah was captured, and Delhi was looted and devastated. According to an estimate, apart from the Peacock Throne and the Kohinoor diamond, seventy crore rupees were collected from the

 Kabul. Thus, India once again became vulnerable to the attacks from the north-west. Ahmad Shah Abdali (or Ahmad Shah Durrani), who was elected the successor of Nadir Shah after the latter’s death in 1747, invaded India several times between 1748 and 1767. He continuously harassed the Mughals who tried to buy peace in 1751–52 by ceding Punjab to him. In 1757, Abdali captured Delhi and left behind an A

Before his return, Abdali had recognised Alamgir II as the Mughal emperor and the Rohilla chief, Najib-ud-Daula, as Mir Bakhshi of the empire, who was to act as personal ‘supreme agent’ of Abdali. In 1758, Najib-ud-Daula was expelled from Delhi by the Maratha chief, Raghunath Rao, who also captured Punjab. In 1759, Ahmad Shah Abdali returned to India to take revenge on the Marathas. In 1761, Abdali de

feated the Marathas in the Third Battle of Panipat. The last of Abdali’s invasions came in 1767. View Nader Shah was Mughal emperor for only fifty-seven days, in 1739, but those days created aftershocks that transformed India's politics. They broke existing centres of authority, massively shrinking the scope of Mughal power. They set loose bands of mounted warrior

These battles changed the course of Indian history at different points of time. ● The first Battle of Panipat in 1526 was between Babur and Ibrahim Lodi. The result of the battle laid the foundation of the Mughal Empire by ending the rule of the Delhi Sultanate. ● The Second Battle of Panipat in 1556 was between Akb

 Weak Rulers after Aurangzeb—An Internal Challenge Bahadur Shah I (ruled 1707–12) After a nearly twoyear- long war of succession, the 63-year-old Prince Mu’azzam, the eldest son of Aurangzeb, became the emperor, taking the title Bahadur Shah. He was later called Bahadur Shah I

iefs were confirmed in their respective states. However, the Sikh leader Banda Bahadur attacked the Muslims in Punjab, and, hence, the emperor took action against him. Bahadur Shah I died in February 1712. Jahandar Shah (ruled 1712–13) With the help of Zulfikar Khan, Jahandar Shah became the emperor. Zulfikar Khan was appointed prime minister; he introduced izara system to improve the financial condit

ion of the empire. Jahandar Shah abolished Jaziya. Farrukhsiyar (ruled 1713–1719) After killing Jahandar Shah with the help of Sayyid brothers—Abdulla Khan and Hussain Ali (known as ‘King Makers’), Farrukhsiyar became the new emperor. He followed a policy of religious tolerance b

y abolishing Jaziya and pilgrimage tax. In 1717, he gave farmans to the British. In 1719, the Sayyid brothers, with the help of Peshwa Balaji Vishwanath, dethroned Farrukhsiyar. Later, he was blinded and killed. It was the first time in the Mughal history that an emperor was killed by hi

s nobles. Rafi-ud-Darajat (ruled Feb. 28–June 6, 1719) He ruled for the shortest period among the Mughals. View He (Bahadur Shah I) was the last Emperor of whom anything favourable can be said. Henceforth, the rapid and complete abasement and practical 

 Rafi-ud-Daula (ruled June 6–Sep. 17, 1719) The Sayyid brothers placed Rafi-ud-Daula with the title Shah Jahan II on the throne. The new emperor was an opium addict. Muhammad Shah (ruled 1719–48) After the death of Rafi-ud-Daula, Raushan Akhtar became the choice of the Sayyid Brothers. Muhammad Shah, as he came to be known in history, was given the title of ‘Rangeela’ due to his luxurious

 lifestyle. Muhammad Shah, with the help of Nizam-ul-Mulk, killed the Sayyid Brothers. In 1724, Nizam-ul-Mulk became the wazir and founded the independent state of Hyderabad. In 1737, Baji Rao I, the Maratha Peshwa, invaded Delhi with a small army of 500 horsemen. In 1739, Nadir Shah defeated the Mughals in the Battle of Karnal and later imprisoned Muhammad Shah and annexed areas

 west of the Indus into the Persian empire. Ahmad Shah Bahadur (ruled 1748–1754) Ahmad Shah was an incompetent ruler who left the state affairs in the hands of Udham Bai, the ‘Queen Mother’. Udham Bai, given the title of Qibla-i-Alam, was a lady of poor intellect who ruled with 

the help of her paramour, Javid Khan (a notorious eunuch). Alamgir II (ruled 1754–59) Alamgir II was a son of Emperor Jahandar Shah. Ahmed Shah Abdali, the Iranian invader, reached Delhi in January 1757. During his reign, the Battle of Plassey was fought in June 1757. Alamgir II was assassinated. Shah Jahan III (ruled 1759–60) Also known as Muhiul- millat, he was placed on the throne as a result of 

the intrigues in Delhi, but was latter deposed through Maratha intervention. Shah Alam II (ruled Oct. 1760–July 1788; Oct. 1788–Nov. 1806) His reign saw two decisive battles—the Third Battle of Panipat (1761) and the Battle of Buxar (1764). In 1765, according to the terms of Treaty of Allahabad (August 1765), he was taken under the Eas

 Diwani (the right to collect revenue) of Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa. In 1772, the Marathas took him to Delhi where he lived till 1803. In 1803, he again accepted the protection of the English, after the defeat of Daulat Rao Scindia by the English. Afterwards, the Mughal emperor became the pensioner of the English. Akbar Shah II (ruled 1806–

37) He gave the title of ‘Raja’ to Rammohan Roy. During his regime, in 1835, the East India Company discontinued calling itself subject of the Mughal emperor, and stopped issuing coins in the name of the Mughal emperor. Bahadur Shah II (ruled 1837–57) Bahadur Shah II or Baha

dur Shah Zafar (Zafar being his surname) was the last Mughal emperor. The Revolt of 1857 had made a futile attempt to declare him the Emperor of India. He was captured by the English and sent to Rangoon where he died in 1862. In legal terms, the Mughal Empire came to an end on November 1

, 1858 with the declaration of Queen Victoria. Causes of Decline of the Mughal Empire Why the Mughal Empire declined has been a subject of debate among historians. Scholarly opinion can be divided along two

ent parts of the empire. The decline was due to both aspects. The process of disintegration of the Mughal Empire began during the reign of Aurangzeb, but it picked up momentum only after his death in 1707. At his death, conditions were not such that the process of decline could not be checked. Although Mughal authority was challenged by several chiefs and rulers, none could assert independence  

f character also played their due role but they have necessarily to be seen against the background of these deeper, more impersonal factors. —Satish Chandra, Parties and Politics at the Mughal Court, 1707–40 Various explanations are put forward for the revolts which brought about the collapse of the Mughal Empire... Here our main concern is with what our 17th and early 18th century authorities have to

They forged northwards and, by 1740, succeeded in spreading their influence over the provinces of Gujarat, Malwa, and Bundelkhand. The Rajput struggle against the empire and the growing ambition and power of the Marathas, thus, adverse

f the Asaf-Jah house of Hyderabad was Kilich Khan, popularly known as Nizam-ul-Mulk. It was Zulfikar Khan who had first conceived the idea of an independent state in the Deccan. But with his death in 1713, the dream remained unfulfilled. Kilich Khan, disgusted with the Mughal emperor who had appointed Mubariz Khan as a full-fledged viceroy of the Deccan, decided to fight Mubariz Khan. He defeated and 

later killed Mubariz Khan in the Battle of Shakr- Kheda (1724). He now assumed control of the Deccan. In 1725, he became the viceroy and conferred on himself the title of Asaf-Jah. Awadh The founder of the independent principality of Awadh was Saadat Khan, popularly known as Burhan-ul-Mulk. Saadat Khan was a

eeded by Safdar Jang as the Nawab of Awadh. Bengal Murshid Kuli Khan was the founder of the independent state of Bengal. He was a capable ruler and made Bengal a prosperous state. He was succeeded in 1727 by his son Shujaud- din. His successor, Sarfaraz Khan, was killed in 1740 by Alivardi Khan, the deputy governor of Bihar at Gheria, who assumed power and made himself independent of the Mughal empero

r by giving yearly tribute. The Rajputs The Rajputs tried to re-establish their independence in the 18th century. This forced the Mughal ruler Bahadur Shah I to march against Ajit Singh (1708), who had formed an alliance with Jai Singh II and Durgadas Rathor. But the alliance was broken and the situation was saved for the Mughals. At one time the Rajputs controlled the entire territory ex

 The first major rebellion by the Jats against Mughal imperial forces occurred in Mathura district in 1669. It was led by Gokula. It was not successful. After some initial setbacks, Churaman and Badan Singh succeeded in setting up the Jat kingdom of Bharatpur in the 18th century. But it was under Suraj Ma

ded territories from Ganga in the east to Chambal in the south and included the Subahs of Agra, Mathura, Meerut, and Aligarh. However, the Jat state suffered a decline after the death of Suraj Mal in 1763. Thereafter, the state split into small areas controlled by petty zamindars who mainly lived by plunder. The Sikhs In 1675, Aurangzeb arrested and executed the ninth Sikh guru, Guru Tegh Bahadur, who

h Bahadur, openly rebelled against Aurangzeb. He transformed the Sikhs into a militant sect in defence of their religion and liberties. Banda Bahadur, who later assumed the leadership of the Sikhs in 1708, was defeated and killed. In the wake of the invasions of Nadir Shah and Ahmad Shah Abdali, the Sikhs once again asserted their authority. At this stage, they organised themselves into 12 misls or co

b goes to Ranjit Singh. He was the son of Mahan Singh, the leader of the Sukarchakiya misl. Ranjit Singh brought under control the area extending from the Sutlej to the Jhelum. He conquered Lahore in 1799 and Amritsar in 1802. By the Treaty of Amritsar with the British, Ranjit Singh acknowledged the British right over the Cis-Sutlej territories. Ranjit Singh proved to be an efficient administrator. He

 greatly modernised his army with the help of Europeans. But towards the close of his reign, the English forced him to sign the Tripartite Treaty in 1838 with Shah Shuja and the  

 English Company whereby he agreed to provide passage to the British troops through Punjab with a view to placing Shah Shuja on the throne of Kabul. Ranjit Singh died in 1839. His successors could not keep the state intact, and, soon enough, the British took control over it. The Marathas Perhaps the most formidable province to emerge was that of the Marathas. Under the ca

d established their rule. At one time they claimed the right to be the chief inheritors of the Mughal dominion, but their authority was challenged by Ahmad Shah Abdali in the Third Battle of Panipat (1761). The Marathas quickly recovered from the defeat and offered the most formidable challenge to the English East India Company in the struggle for political supremacy in India. Rohilakhand and Farukhab

e entire imperial history of Britain can be periodised into two phases, the ‘first empire’ stretching across the Atlantic towards America and the West Indies, and the ‘second empire’ beginning around 1783 (Peace of Paris) and swinging towards the East—Asia and Africa. The imperial history of Britain started with the conquest of Ireland in the 16th century. The English then sprang up as the ‘new Romans

ey resorted to aggressive application of the subsidiary alliance system to extend British dominion in India as a defensive counter measure against the imperialistic designs of France and Russia. From 1798 to 1818 the British motives were consciously imperialistic. Lord Hastings further carried the policy of Wellesley and treated India as a conquered rather than an acquired country. Thereafter, the Bri

id the British Period Begin in India? In mid-18th-century India, various historical forces were at work, consequent to which the country moved towards a new direction. Some historians regard the year 1740, when the Anglo-French struggle for supremacy in India began in the wake of the War of Austrian Succession in Europe, as the beginning of the British period. Some see the year 1757, when the British 

defeated the Nawab of Bengal at Plassey, as the designated date. Still others regard 1761, the year of the Third Battle of Panipat when the Marathas were defeated by Ahmad Shah Abdali, as the beginning of this phase of Indian history. However, all such chronological landmarks are somewhat

 arbitrary because the political transformation which began around that time took about eighty years to complete. For instance, as we think of 1761, the British would certainly come to mind (because of their victory over the Nawab of Bengal at Plassey and over the French) but we would not entirely write off the Marathas and would probably also c

handicrafts, etc. The English East India Company had vital commercial interests in trading in Bengal, as nearly 60 per cent of the British imports from Asia consisted of goods from Bengal. During the 1630s, regular contact of the British with Bengal continued when they established factories in Balasore, Hooghly, Kasimbazar, Patna, and Dacca. By the 1690s, the foundation of Calcutta by the English comp

y paid a sum of Rs 3,000 (£ 350) per annum to the Mughal emperor who allowed them to trade freely in Bengal. In contrast, the Company’s exports from Bengal were worth more than £ 50,000 per annum. In 1700, Murshid Quli Khan became the Dewan of Bengal and ruled till his death in 1727. He was succeeded by his son-in-law, Shujauddin, who ruled till 1739. After that, for a year (1739–40), Sarfaraz Khan, a

n incapable son of Murshid Quli Khan, became the ruler; he was killed by Alivardi Khan. Alivardi Khan ruled till 1756 and also stopped paying tributes to the Mughal emperor. Under the rule of these rulers, Bengal made unprecedented progress. There were other factors too, which made Bengal prosperous, for  

vasions, Jat revolts, and external invasions by Nadir Shah and Ahmed Shah Abdali. The region of Bengal was fortunate enough to escape these challenges. The population of Calcutta rose from 15,000 (in 1706) to 100,000 (in 1750), and other cities like Dacca and Murshidabad became highly populous. Almost all the governors of Bengal strongly resented the special privileges enjoyed by the English company a

oss to the provincial exchequer. So, the friction between the English commercial interests and the Bengal government became the chief cause for conflict between the two. During a short period between 1757 and 1765, the power gradually got transferred from the Nawabs of Bengal to the British, with the latter defeating the former. Alivardi Khan and the English In 1741, Alivardi Khan, the Deputy Governor

di Khan’s apprehensions were drawn to the Carnatic region, where the European companies had usurped all power; on realising this, he was urged to expel the Europeans from Bengal. But he died in April 1756 and was succeeded by his grandson, Siraj-ud-Daulah, the son of Alivardi’s youngest daughter. Challenges Before Siraj-ud-Daulah A youth just in his twentieth year, Siraj inherited many troubles from h

 reward the Company for its services. The secret alliance of the Company with the conspirators further strengthened the English position. So, the English victory in the Battle of Plassey (June 23, 1757) was decided before the battle was even fought. Due to the conspiracy of the nawab’s officials, the 50,000-strong force of Siraj was defeated by a handful of Clive’s forces. Siraj-ud-Daulah was captu

dependent for maintaining his newly acquired position. The sovereignty of the English over Calcutta was recognised, and the English posted a resident at the nawab’s court. Mir Kasim and the Treaty of 1760 Mir Jafar was increasingly irritated by the interference of Clive. He entered into a conspiracy with the Dutch at Chinsura. But the Dutch were defeated and humbled by the English forces at Bedara in 

November 1759. The treachery of Mir Jafar and his failure to make the payments due to the Company, annoyed the English. Meanwhile, Miran, the son of Jafar died and there started a fight for the nawabship of Bengal

 agreed to support Mir Kasim’s claim after a treaty between Mir Kasim and the Company was signed in 1760. Important features of the treaty were as follows: (i) Mir Kasim agreed to cede to the Company the districts of Burdwan, Midnapur, and Chittagong. (ii) The Company would get half of the share in chun

sted against this and insisted upon having preferential treatment as against other traders. The Nawab-Company tussle over transit duty led to the outbreak of wars between the English and Mir Kasim in 1763. The English gained successive victories at Katwah, Murshidabad, Giria, Sooty, and Munger. Mir Kasim fled to Awadh (or Oudh) and formed a confederacy with the Nawab of Awadh, Shuja-ud-Daulah, and the

recover Bengal from the English. The Battle The combined armies of Mir Kasim, the Nawab of Awadh, and Shah Alam II were defeated by the English forces under Major Hector Munro at Buxar on October 22, 1764 in a closely contested battle. The English campaign against Mir Kasim was short but decisive. The importance of this battle lay in the fact that not only the Nawab of Bengal but also the Mughal Emper

a was defeated by the English. The victory made the English a great power in northern India and contenders for the supremacy over the whole country. After the battle, Mir Jafar, who was made Nawab in 1763 when relations between Mir Kasim and the Company became strained, agreed to hand over the districts of  

 administration lay in the hands of the naib-subahdar, who could be appointed or dismissed by the English. The Treaty of Allahabad Robert Clive concluded two important treaties at Allahabad in August 1765—one with the Nawab of Awadh and the other with the Mughal Emperor, Shah Alam II. Nawab Shuja-ud-Daula agreed to: (i) surrender Allahabad and Kara to Emperor Shah Alam II; (ii) pay Rs 50 lakh to the C

erence to Robert Clive, who joined the army after resigning from a clerk’s post. He was instrumental in laying the foundations of British power in India. He was made the Governor of Bengal twice from 1757 to 1760 and then from 1765 to 1767. He administered Bengal under the dual government system till his return to England where he allegedly committed suicide in 1774.  

 emperor’s farman legalised the political gains of the Company in Bengal. Mir Kasim, the dethroned Nawab of Bengal, spent the rest of his life in abject misery as a homeless wanderer and died in June 1777. Dual Government in Bengal (1765–72) After the battle of Buxar, the East India Company became the real masters of Bengal. Robert Clive introduced the dual system of government, i.e., the rule of the 

dministrative breakdown and proved disastrous for the people of Bengal. Neither the Company nor the Nawab cared for administration and public welfare. Warren Hastings did away with the dual system in 1772.  

 Mysore’s Resistance to the Company The Wodeyar / Mysore Dynasty After the battle of Talikota (1565) gave a deadly blow to the great kingdom of Vijayanagara, many small kingdoms emerged from its remnants. In 1612 a Hindu kingdom under the Wodeyars emerged in the region of Mysore. Chikka Krishnaraja

 Wodeyar II ruled from 1734 to 1766. During the second half of the 18th century, Mysore emerged as a formidable power under the leadership of Haidar Ali and Tipu Sultan. The English felt their political and commercial interests in Sout

er Madras. Rise of Haidar Ali In the early 18th century two brothers, Nanjaraj (the sarvadhikari) and Devaraj (the Dulwai) had reduced Chikka Krishnaraja Wodeyar to a mere puppet. Haidar Ali, born in 1721 in an obscure family, started his career as a horseman in the Mysore army under the ministers, Nanjaraj and Devaraj. Views Whether regarded as a duel between the foreigner and the native, or as an ev

 The need of the hour was a leader with high degree of military powers and diplomatic skill. Haidar Ali fulfilled that need and usurped the royal authority by becoming the de facto ruler of Mysore in 1761. He realised that the exceedingly mobile Marathas could be contained only by a swift cavalry, that the cannons of the French-trained Nizami army could be silenced only by an effective artillery, and 

training for his army. He also started to use his considerable diplomatic skill to outmanoeuvre his opponents. With his superior military skill, he captured Dod Ballapur, Sera, Bednur, and Hoskote in 1761–63, and brought to submission the troublesome Poligars of South India (in what is now Tamil Nadu). Recovering from their defeat at Panipat, the Marathas under Madhavrao attacked Mysore, and defeated 

Haidar Ali in 1764, 1766, and 1771. To buy peace, Haidar Ali had to give them large sums of money, but after Madhavrao’s death in 1772, Haidar Ali raided the Marathas a number of times during 1774–76 and recovered all the territories he had previously lost, besides capturing new areas. First Anglo-Mysore War (1767-69) Background After their easy success in Bengal, the English were confident of

 their military strength. They concluded a treaty with the Nizam of Hyderabad (1766), persuading him to give them the Northern Circars (region) in lieu of which they said they would protect the Nizam from Haidar Ali. Haidar already had territorial disputes with the Nawab of Arcot an

r changed his strategy and suddenly appeared before the gates of Madras. There was complete chaos and panic at Madras forcing the English to conclude a very humiliating treaty with Haidar on April 4, 1769—the Treaty of Madras. The treaty provided for the exchange of prisoners and mutual restitution of conquests. Haidar Ali was promised the help of the English in case he was attacked by any other power

. Second Anglo-Mysore War (1780–84) Background Haidar Ali accused the English of breach of faith and nonobservance of the Treaty of Madras when in 1771 he was attacked by the Marathas, and the English failed to come to his aid. Also, he found that the French were much more helpful than the English in meeting his army’s requirement of guns, saltpetre

 Colonel Baillie in 1781. In the meantime, the English (under Sir Eyre Coote) detached both the Marathas and the Nizam from Haidar’s side, but the undeterred Haidar faced the English boldly only to suffer a defeat at Porto N

ovo in November 1781. However, he regrouped his forces and defeated the English and captured their commander, Braithwaite. Treaty of Mangalore Haidar Ali died of cancer on December 7, 1782. Now his son, Tipu Sultan, carried on the war for one year without any positive outcome. Fed up with an inconclusive war, both sides opted for peace, negotiating the Treaty of Mangalore (March, 1784)

e had purchased Jalkottal and Cannanore from the Dutch in the Cochin state. As Cochin was a feudatory of Tipu, he considered the act of Travancore as a violation of his sovereign rights. So, in April 1790, Tipu declared war against Travancore for the restoration of his rights. Course of War The English, siding with Travancore, attacked Tipu. In 1790, Tipu defeated the English under General Meadows. In

 1791, Cornwallis took the leadership and at the head of a large army marched through Ambur and Vellore to Bangalore (captured in March 1791) and from there to Seringapatam. Coimbatore fell to them, but they lost it again, and at last with the support of the Marathas and the Nizam, the English attacked Seringapatam for the second time. Ti

pu offered serious opposition, but the odds were against him. Consequently, he had to pay heavily under the Treaty of Seringapatam. Treaty of Seringapatam Under this treaty of 1792, nearly half of the Mysorean territory was taken over by the victors. Baramahal, Dindigul, and Malabar went to the English, while the Marathas got the regions surrounding the Tungabhadra and its trib

 while the rest was to be given in installments, for which Tipu’s two sons were taken as hostages by the English. Fourth Anglo-Mysore War Background The English as well as Tipu Sultan used the period 1792 to 1799 to recoup their losses. Tipu fulfilled all the terms of the Treaty of Seringapatam and got his sons released. In 1796, when the Hindu ruler of Wodeyar dynasty died, Tipu refused to place Wode

yar’s minor son on the throne and declared himself sultan. He also decided to avenge his humilitating defeat and the terms put by the Treaty of Seringapatam. In 1798, Lord Wellesley succeeded Sir John Shore as the new governor general. An imperialist to the core, Wellesley was concerned about Tipu’s growing friendship with the French and aimed at annihilating Tip

ghanistan, Kabul, and Zaman Shah, as also to Isle of France (Mauritius) and Versailles, with treasonable intent. Tipu’s explanation did not satisfy Wellesley. Course of War The war began on April 17, 1799 and ended on May 4, 1799 with the fall of Seringapatam. Tipu was defeated first by English General Stuart and then by General Harris. Arthur Wellesley, the brother of Lord Wellesley, also participate

 Estimate of Tipu Sultan Tipu Sultan was born in November 1750 to Haidar Ali and Fatima. A well-educated man, he could freely converse in Arabic, Persian, Kanarese, and Urdu. Tipu was a great warrior (he was known as the ‘Tiger of Mysore’) and gave maximum care 

ough he took the help of the French officers to train his soldiers, he never allowed them (French) to develop into a pressure group. Like his father, Tipu realised the importance of a naval force. In 1796, he set up a Board of Admiralty and planned for a fleet of 22 battleships and 20 large frigates. Three dockyards were established at Mangalore, Wajedabad, and Molidabad. However, his plans did not fr

er in introducing sericulture to the Mysore State. Tipu was a great lover of democracy and a great diplomat. He gave his support to the French soldiers at Seringapatam in setting up a Jacobin Club in 1797. He ordered a salute of 2,300 cannons and 500 rockets to celebrate the occasion. Tipu himself became a member of the Jacobin Club and allowed himself to be called Citizen Tipu. He planted the Tree of

cted Hindu temples within his own kingdom. He sanctioned funds for the repair of the Sringeri Temple and installation of the idol of Goddess Sarada (the idol had been damaged during a Maratha raid in 1791). It is necessary not to judge characters of the past with modern yardsticks of secularism and democracy. Tipu despised the use of palanquins and described them as fit only for use of women and the d

dle of the 18th century, they were in Lahore thinking of becoming rulers of the North Indian empire and in the court of the Mughals playing the role of kingmakers. Though the Third Battle of Panipat (1761), in which they were defeated by Ahmad Shah Abdali, changed the situation, they regrouped, regained their strength, and, within a decade, achieved a position of power in India. Bajirao I (1720–40), c

e of Nagpur; (iii) the Holkars of Indore; (iv) the Sindhias of Gwalior; and (v) the Peshwa of Poona. The confederacy, under Bajirao I to Madhavrao I, worked cordially but the Third Battle of Panipat (1761) changed everything. The defeat at Panipat and later the death of the young Peshwa, Madhavrao I, in 1772, weakened the control of the Peshwas over the confederacy. Though the chiefs of the confederac

y united on occasion, as against the British (1775–82), more often they quarrelled among themselves. Entry of the English into Maratha Politics The years between the last quarter of the 18th century and the first quarter of the 19th century witnessed

es of the arrangement made by Clive in Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa. So, it was a longed-for opportunity for the English when dissensions over a succession divided the Marathas. First Anglo-Maratha War (1775–82) Background After the death of Madhavrao in 1772, his brother Narayanrao succeeded him as the fifth peshwa. However, Narayanrao’s uncle, Raghunathrao, had his nephew assassinated and named himself

 peshwa and rule for him as regents. Treaties of Surat and Purandhar Raghunathrao, unwilling to give up his position in power, sought help from the English at Bombay and signed the Treaty of Surat in 1775. Under the treaty, Raghunathrao ceded the territories of Salsette and Bassein to the English along with a portion of the revenues from Surat and Bharuch districts. In return, the English were to prov

ide Raghunathrao with 2,500 soldiers. The British Calcutta Council, on the other side of India, condemned the Treaty of Surat (1775) and sent Colonel Upton to Pune to annul it and make a new treaty (Treaty of Purandhar, 1776) with the regency renouncing Raghunath and promising him a pension. The Bombay government rejected this an

d gave refuge to Raghunath. In 1777, Nana Phadnavis violated his treaty with the Calcutta Council by granting the French a port on the west coast. The English retaliated by sending a force towards Pune.  

 forcing them to retreat to the village of Wadgaon. Here, the English army was surrounded on all sides by the Marathas and cut off from food and water supplies. The English surrendered by mid-January 1779 and signed the Treaty of Wadgaon that forced the Bombay government to relinquish all territories acquired by the English since 1775. Treaty of Salbai (1782): End of the First Phase of the Struggle Wa

rren Hastings, the Governor General in Bengal, rejected the Treaty of Wadgaon and sent a large force of soldiers under Colonel Goddard, who captured Ahmedabad in February 1779, and Bassein in December 1780. Another Bengal detachment led by Captain Popham captured Gwalior in August 1780. In February 1781, the English, under General Camac, finally defeated Sindhia at Sipri. 

Sindhia proposed a new treaty between the Peshwa and the English, and the Treaty of Salbai was signed in May 1782; it was ratified by Hastings in June 1782 and by Phadnavis in February 1783. The treaty guaranteed peace between the two sides for twenty years. The main provisions of the Treaty of Salbai were: (i) Salsette should continue in the possession of the English. (ii) The whole of

 the territory conquered since the Treaty of Purandhar (1776), including Bassein, should be restored to the Marathas. (iii) In Gujarat, Fateh Singh Gaekwad should remain in possession of the territory which he had before the war and should serve the Peshwa as 

 that their several allies should remain at peace with one another. (ix) Mahadji Scindia should be the mutual guarantor for the proper observance of the terms of the treaty. Second Anglo-Maratha War (1803–05) Background The Second Anglo-Maratha war started in circumstances similar to those of the first. After Peshwa Madhavrao Narayan committed suicide in 1795, Bajirao II, the worthless son of Raghunat

vis, a bitter foe of Bajirao II, became the chief minister. The dissensions among the Marathas provided the English with an opportunity to intervene in Maratha affairs. The death of Nana Phadnavis in 1800 gave the British an added advantage. Course of War On April 1, 1801, the Peshwa brutally murdered the brother of Jaswantrao (also called Yashwantrao by some historians) Holkar, Vithuji. A furious Jas

want arrayed his forces against the combined armies of Scindia and Bajirao II. The turmoil continued, and on October 25, 1802, Jaswant defeated the armies of the Peshwa and Scindia decisively at Hadapsar near Poona and placed Vinayakrao, son of Amritrao, on the Peshwa’s seat. A terrified Bajirao II fled to Bassein where, on

 December 31, 1802, he signed a treaty with the English. Treaty of Bassein (1802) Under the treaty, the Peshwa agreed: (i) to receive from the Company a native infantry (consisting of not less than 6,000 troops), with the usual proportion of field artillery and European artillery

ell-prepared and organised army of the English under Arthur Wellesley defeated the combined armies of Scindia and Bhonsle and forced them to conclude separate subsidiary treaties with the English. In 1804, Yashwantrao Holkar made an attempt to form a coalition of Indian rulers to fight against the English. But his attempt proved unsuccessful. The Marathas were defeated, reduced to British vassalage an

d isolated from one another. [(i) Defeat of Bhonsle (December 17, 1803, Treaty of Deogaon); (ii) Defeat of Scindia (December 30, 1803, Treaty of Surji-Anjangaon); and (iii) Defeat of Holkar (1806, Treaty of Rajpurghat)]. Significance of the Treaty of Bassein Admittedly, the treaty was signed by a Peshwa who lacked political authority, but the gains made by the English were immense. The provis

 Third Anglo-Maratha War (1817–19) Background Lord Hastings had the imperialistic design of imposing British paramountcy. By the Charter Act of 1813, the East India Company’s monopoly of trade in China (except tea) ended and, hence, the company needed more markets. The Pindaris, made up of many castes and classes, were attached to Maratha armies 

 actions taken against the Pindaris were seen as a transgression of the sovereignty of the Marathas; they served to once again unite the Maratha confederacy. A repentant Bajirao II made a last bid in 1817 by rallying together the Maratha chiefs against the English in course of the Third Anglo-Maratha War. Course of War The Peshwa attacked the British Residency at Poona. Appa Sahib of Nagpur attacked t

These were: ● June 1817, Treaty of Poona, with Peshwa. ● November 1817, Treaty of Gwalior, with Scindia. ● January 1818, Treaty of Mandasor, with Holkar. In June 1818, the Peshwa finally surrendered and the Maratha confeder

er a few pushes. Conquest of Sindh In the early 19th century, the English started to show an interest in Sindh where they enjoyed some trade facilities authorised by a farman of the Mughal Emperor in 1630. The farman provided the English with such privileges in the ports of Sindh which they enjoyed elsewhere. Rise of Talpuras Amirs In the 18th century, prior to the rule of Talpuras Amirs, Sindh was ru

led by the Kallora chiefs. In 1758, an English factory was built at Thatta, owing to a parwana given by the Kallora prince, Ghulam Shah. In 1761, Ghulam Shah, on the arrival of an English resident in his court, not only ratified the earlier treaty, but also excluded other Europeans from trading there. This advantage was enjoyed by the English

 up to 1775 when a not-too-friendly ruler, Sarfraz Khan, made the English close their factory. In the 1770s, a Baluch tribe called Talpuras, descended from the hills and settled in the plains of Sindh. They were excellent soldiers as well as adapted to hard life. They acquired great influence and soon usu

rped power in the new region. In 1783, the Talpuras, under the leadership of Mir Fath (Fatah) Ali Khan, established complete hold over Sindh and sent the Kallora prince into exile. The then Durrani monarch confirmed the claims of Mir Fat

h Khan and ordered the latter to share the country with his brothers (Mir’s brothers, popularly known as ‘Char Yar’). When Mir Fath died in 1800, the Char Yar divided the kingdom among themselves, calling themselves the Amirs or Lords of Sindh. These amirs extended their dominion on all sides. They conquered Amarkot from the Raja of Jodhpur, 

 chief of Luz, and Shaikarpur and Bukkar from the Afghans. Gradual Ascendancy over Sindh A common belief in the late 18th century was that Napoleon was conspiring with Tipu Sultan to invade India. In 1799, behind Lord Wellesley’s efforts to revive commercial relations  

h. Negotiations were opened with Fath Ali Khan. But under the influence of Tipu Sultan and the jealousy of the local traders, aided by the anti-British party at Hyderabad (Sindh), the amir in October 1800, ordered the British agent to quit Sindh within ten days. The British agent (Crow) left Sindh and the Company quietly suffered the insult. Treaty of ‘Eternal Friendship’ In June 1807, the alliance of

eir first-ever treaty with the English. After professing eternal friendship, both sides agreed to exclude the French from Sindh and to exchange agents at each other’s court. The treaty was renewed in 1820, with the addition of an article excluding the Americans and resolving some border disputes on the side of Kachch after the final defeat of the Maratha confederacy in 1818. Treaty of 1832 In 1832, Wi

Lord Auckland and Sindh Lord Auckland, who became the Governor General in 1836, looked at Sindh from the perspective of saving India from a possible Russian invasion and wished to obtain a counteracting influence over the Afghans. Ranjit Singh in Punjab was strong enough to res

be kept in the capital at the Amir’s expense or alternatively the English would be given suitable concessions in return. The Amirs initially refused but later agreed reluctantly to sign the treaty in 1838 when the possibility of Ranjit Singh getting help from others was pointed out to them. The treaty permitted the English to intervene in the disputes between the Amirs and the Sikhs as also to establi

sh the presence of a British resident who could go anywhere he liked escorted by English troops. Thus, Sindh was turned into a British protectorate in 1838. Tripartite Treaty of 1838 To address the Afghan problem (as the British imagined it), the Company resorted to further duplicity. Firstly, they persuaded Ranjit Singh to sign a tripartite treaty in June 1838 agreeing to Britis

ve was to obtain finances for the Afghan adventure and obtain so much of the Amirs’ territory as would secure a line of operation against Afghanistan through Sindh. Sindh Accepts Subsidiary Alliance (1839) The Company intended to persuade or compel the Amirs to pay the money and also to consent to the abrogation of that article in the treaty of 1832, which prohibited the movement of English troops in 

Sindh by land or by river. B.L. Grover writes: “Under threat of superior force, the Amirs accepted a treaty in February 1839 by which a British subsidiary force had to be stationed at Shikarpur and Bukkar and the Amirs of Sindh were to pay Rs 3 lakh annually for the maintenance of the Company’s troops.” Henceforth, the Ami

Capitulation of Sindh The first Anglo-Afghan War (1839–42), fought on the soil of Sindh, was never liked by the Amirs of Sindh; neither did they like the presence of the British troops in their region.

Later, in 1784, Kapur Singh Faizullapuria organised the Sikhs under Dal Khalsa, with the objective of uniting followers of Sikhism, politically, culturally, and economically. The whole body of the Khalsa was formed

During the period, 1763 to 1773, many misls started to rule the Punjab region under Sikh chieftains, from Saharanpur in the east to Attock in the west, from the mountaineous regions of the north to Multan in the south. Suka

rchakiya Misl and Ranjit Singh At the time of the birth of Ranjit Singh (November 2, 1780), there were 12 important misls—Ahluwaliya, Bhangi, Dallewalia, Faizullapuria, Kanhaiya, Krorasinghia, Nakkai, Nishaniya, Phulakiya, Ramgarhiya Sukharchakiya, and Shaheed. The central administration 

cades. These events in the neighbouring regions were fully exploited by Ranjit Singh, who followed a ruthless policy of ‘blood and iron’ and carved out for himself a kingdom in the central Punjab. In 1799, Ranjit Singh was appointed as the governor of Lahore by  

 Zaman Shah, the ruler of Afghanistan. In 1805, Ranjit Singh acquired Jammu and Amritsar, and, thus, the political capital (Lahore) and religious capital (Amritsar) of Punjab came under the rule of Ranjit Singh. He also maintained good relations 

th the Dogras and the Nepalese and enlisted them in his army. Ranjit Singh and the English The prospects of a joint Franco-Russian invasion of India through the land-route had alarmed the English. In 1807, Lord Minto sent Charles Metcalfe to Lahore. Ranjit Singh offered to accept Metcalfe’s proposal of an offensive and defensive alliance on the condition that the English would remain neutral in case o

 the negotiations failed. In the changed political scenario in which the Napoleonic danger receded and the English became more assertive, Ranjit Singh agreed to sign the Treaty of Amritsar (April 25, 1809) with the Company. Treaty of Amritsar The Treaty of Amritsar was significant for its immediate as well as potential effects. It checked one of the most cherished ambitions of Ranjit Singh to extend h

is rule over the entire Sikh nation by accepting the river Sutlej as the boundary line for his dominions and the Company’s. Now he directed his energies towards the west and captured Multan (1818), Kashmir (1819), and Peshawar (1834). In June 1838, Ranjit Singh was compelled by political compulsions to sign the Tripartite Treaty with the English; however, he refused to give passage to the Bri

tish army through his territories to attack Dost Mohammad, the Afghan Amir. The relations of Raja Ranjit Singh with the Company, from 1809 to 1839, clearly indicate the former’s weak position. Although he was conscious of his weak position, he took no step to organise a coalition of other Indian princes or maintain a balance of power. Ranjit Si

ngh died in June 1839, and, with his death, the process of the decline of his empire began.  

ourt Factions Ranjit Singh’s only legitimate son and successor, Kharak Singh, was not efficient, and during the brief period of his reign, court factions became active. Kharak Singh’s sudden death in 1839 and the accidental death of his son, Prince Nau Nihal Singh (when he was returning from his father’s funeral), led to an anarchic situation in Punjab. Plans and counter plans of various groups to cap

sulted in commotion and economic dislocation in Punjab. Rani Jindal and Daleep Singh After the death of Nau Nihal Singh, Sher Singh, another son of Ranjit Singh succeeded, but he was murdered in late 1843. Soon afterwards, Daleep Singh, a minor son of Ranjit Singh, was proclaimed the Maharaja with Rani Jindan as regent and Hira Singh Dogra as wazir. Hira Singh himself fell a victim to a court intrigue

 and was murdered in 1844. The new wazir, Jawahar Singh, the brother of Rani Jindan, soon incurred the displeasure of the army and was deposed and put to death in 1845. Lal Singh, a lover of Rani Jindan, won over the army to his side and became the wazir in the same year, and Teja Singh was appointed as the commander of the forces. First Anglo-Sikh War (1845–46) Ca

 Sutlej on December 11, 1845. This was seen as an aggressive manoeuvre that provided the English with the justification to declare war. The causes were, however, much more complex and may be listed as follows: (i) the anarchy in

 the court at Lahore and the ever-powerful and increasingly local army; (ii) suspicions amongst the Sikh army arising from English military campaigns to achieve the annexation of Gwalior and Sindh in 1841 and the campaign in Afghanistan in 1842; and (iii) the increase in the number of English troops being stationed near the border with the Lahore kingdom. Course of War The war began in December 1845, 

ish side, while the Sikhs had about 50,000 men under the overall command of Lal Singh. But the treachery of Lal Singh and Teja Singh caused five successive defeats to the Sikhs at Mudki (December 18, 1845), Ferozeshah (December 21–22, 1845), Buddelwal, Aliwal (January 28, 1846), and at Sobraon (February 10, 1846). Lahore fell to the British forces on February 20, 1846 without a fight. Treaty of Lahore

 (March 8, 1846) The end of the first Anglo-Sikh War forced the Sikhs to sign a humiliating treaty on March 8, 1846. The main features of the Treaty of Lahore were as follows: ● War indemnity of more than 1 crore rupees was to be given to the English. ● The Jalandhar Doab (between the Beas and the Sutlej) was anne

 and he was required to pay 75 lakh rupees to the Company as the price. The transfer of Kashmir to Gulab Singh was formalised by a separate treaty on March 16, 1846. Treaty of Bhairowal The Sikhs were not satisfied with the Treaty of Lahore over the issue of Kashmir, so they rebelled. In December, 1846, the Treaty of Bhairowal was signed. According to the provis

Rani Jindan was removed as regent and a council of regency for Punjab was set up. The council consisted of 8 Sikh sardars presided over by the English Resident, Henry Lawrence. Second Anglo-Sikh War (1848–49) Causes The defeat in the first Anglo-Sikh War and the provisions of the treaties of Lahore and Bhairowal were highly humiliating for the Sikhs. Inhuman treatment meted out to Rani Jindan, who was

These three battles were: (i) Battle of Ramnagar, led by Sir Hugh Gough, the commander-in-chief of the Company (ii) Battle of Chillhanwala, January, 1849 (iii) Battle of Gujarat, February 21, 1849; the Sikh army surrendered at Rawalpindi, and their Afghan allies were chased out of India. (Gujarat is a small town on the banks of River Jhelum.)  

 Result At the end of the war came: ● surrender of the Sikh army and Sher Singh in 1849; ● annexation of Punjab; and for his services the Earl of Dalhousie was given the thanks of the British Parliament and a promotion in the peerage, as Marquess; ● setting up of a three-member board to

 govern Punjab, comprising of the Lawrence brothers (Henry and John) and Charles Mansel. In 1853, the board was nullified and Punjab was placed under a chief commissioner. John Lawrence became the first chief commissioner. Significance of the Anglo-Sikh Wars The Anglo-Sikh wars gave the two side

s a mutual respect for each other’s fighting prowess. The Sikhs were to fight loyally on the British side in the Revolt of 1857 and in many other campaigns and wars uptil the Indian independence in 1947. Extension of British Paramountcy Through Administrative Policy The process of imperial expansion and consolidation of British paramountcy was carried on by the Company during the 1757–1857 period th

ought to reduce the Indian states into a position of dependence on the British government. Subsidiary Alliance The subsidiary alliance system was used by Lord Wellesley, who was governor general from 1798–1805, to build an empire in India. Under the system, the allying Indian state’s ruler was compelled to accept the permanent stationing of a British force within his territory and to pay a subsidy for

the system to various Indian states and brought it to near perfection. The first Indian state to fall into this protection trap (which anticipated the subsidiary alliance system) was Awadh, which, in 1765, signed a treaty under which the Company pledged to defend the frontiers of Awadh on the condition of the Nawab defraying the expenses of such defence. It was in 1787 that the Company first insisted 

that the subsidiary state should not have foreign relations. This was included in the treaty with the Nawab of Carnatic which Cornwallis signed in February 1787. It was Wellesley’s genius to make it a general rule to negotiate for the surrender of territory in full sovereignty for the maintenance of the subsidiary force.

States which Accepted Alliance The Indian princes who accepted the subsidiary system were: the Nizam of Hyderabad (September 1798 and 1800), the ruler of Mysore (1799), the ruler of Tanjore (October 1799), the Nawab of Awadh (November 1801), the Peshwa (December 1801), the Bhonsle Raja of Berar (December 1803), the Scindia (Feb

ruary 1804), the Rajput states of Jodhpur, Jaipur, Macheri, Bundi, and the ruler of Bharatpur (1818). The Holkars were the last Maratha confederation to accept the Subsidiary Alliance in 1818.  

 Views A 1950 Colonial Office paper disarmingly says that Britain ‘as a seafaring and trading nation... had long been a “collector of islands and peninsulas”’. In a much-quoted remark, Sir John Seeley, the Regius 

Professor of Modern History at Cambridge, said something similar in 1883: ‘We seem, as it were, to have conquered and peopled half the world in a fit of absence of mind. That didn’t mean quite what it seemed to say: what Seeley meant was that there had not been a coherent

 policy behind Britain’s imperial expansion. There had been an incoherent set of policies. The 1950 paper explained that the collection of islands and peninsulas was assembled to protect trade and the sea routes. The motive for Empire was selfish… the motivation consisted of desires which interlock

ance of the subsidiary troops. In addition, large contributions were realised by Lord Hastings, Lord Amherst, and Lord William Bentinck for purposes entirely unconnected with the affairs of Awadh. In 1819, the Nawab was given the title and status of a king. Lord Dalhousie directed Sleeman, the Resident in Awadh, to make a tour throughout the state and ascertain the actual situation by personal inspect

ion. The resident submitted a report describing the anarchical condition in the state. He was succeeded as resident in 1854 by Outram who submitted a report supporting that of his predecessor. Dalhousie hesitated to take the extreme step, i.e., annexation; he preferred permanent British administration, with the Nawab reta

ining his titles and rank. But the Court of Directors ordered annexation and abolition of the throne (1856). Wajid Ali Shah refused to sign a treaty giving away his rights, and was exiled to Calcutta. It was a political blunder for which the British had to pay a heavy price during the Revolt of 1857. an I

vassal on account of ‘lapse’ (i.e., leaving no issue as heir) were rather rare. Maharaja Ranjit Singh had annexed a few of his feudatory principalities on account of ‘lapse’. Likewise, the Company in 1820 acquired a few petty Cis-Sutlej states on the absence of heirs. Nonetheless, there was no clear-cut instance of an adopted son being deprived of an entire state or of such a state being regarded as a

 ‘lapse’. Though this policy is attributed to Lord Dalhousie (1848–56), he was not its originator. It was a coincidence that during his governor-generalship several important cases arose in which the ‘Doctrine’ could be applied. Dalhousie showed too much zeal in enf

 matter of chance that during Lord Dalhousie’s term many rulers of states died without a male issue and seven states were annexed under the Doctrine of Lapse. The most important of these were Satara (1848), Jhansi, and Nagpur (1854). The other small states included Jaitpur (Bundelkhand), Sambhalpur (Orissa), and Baghat (Himachal Pradesh). Lord Dalhousie annexed Awadh in 1856 after deposing Nawab Wajid

 Ali Shah on grounds of misgovernment. Thus, Dalhousie annexed eight states during his eightyear tenure (1848–56) as governor general. In these eight years, he annexed some quarter million square miles of the territory of India. His reign almost completed the process of expansion of British power in India, w

hich began with the victory over Siraj-ud-Daulah at Plassey in 1757. Relations of British India with Neighbouring Countries The desire of the British imperialists to consolidate their administrative and political power in the region led them into conflict with countr

ies neighbouring India. Anglo-Bhutanese Relations The occupation of Assam in 1826 brought the British into close contacts with the mountain state of Bhutan. Frequent raids by Bhutanese into adjoining territories in Assam and Bengal and the bad treatment meted out to Elgin’s envoy 

in 1863–64 and the treaty imposed on him, by which the British were forced to surrender the passes leading to Assam, led to British annexation of these passes and the stopping of allowance paid to the Bhutan

ese. In 1865, the Bhutanese were forced to surrender the passes in return for an annual subsidy. It was the surrendered district which became a productive area with tea gardens.  

 Anglo-Nepalese Relations The Gorkhas wrested control of Nepal from the successors of Ranjit Malla of Bhatgaon in 1760. They began to expand their dominion beyond the mountains. They found it easier to expand in the southern direction, as the north was well defended by the Chinese. In 1801, the English annexed Gorakh

pur, which brought the Gorkhas’ boundary and the Company’s boundary together. The conflict started due to the Gorkhas’ capture of Butwal and Sheoraj in the period of Lord Hastings (1813–23). The war ended in the Treaty of Sagauli in 1816, which was in favour of the British. As per the treaty, ● Nepal accepted a British resident. ● Nepal ceded the districts of Garhwal and Kumaon, and

ufactures in Burma and the need to check French ambitions in Burma and the rest of South-East Asia, resulted in three Anglo-Burmese Wars, and in the end, the annexation of Burma into British India in 1885. First Burma War (1824–26) The first war with Burma was fought when the Burmese expansion westwards and occupation of Arakan and Manipur, and the threat to Assam and the Brahmaputra Valley led to con

 century. The British expeditionary forces occupied Rangoon in May 1824 and reached within 72 km of the capital at Ava. Peace was established in 1826 with the Treaty of Yandabo, which provided that the Government of Burma: ● pay one crore rupees as war compensation; ● cede its coastal provinces of Arakan and Tenasserim; ● abandon claims on Assam, 

Jaintia; ● recognise Manipur as an independent state; ● negotiate a commercial treaty with Britain; and ● accept a British resident at Ava while posting a Burmese envoy at Calcutta. Second Burma War (1852) The second war was the result of the British commercial need and the imperialist policy of Lord Dalhousie. The British merchants were keen to get hold of timber resources of upper Burma and also sou

h occupied Pegu, the only remaining coastal province of Burma. An intense guerrilla resistance had to be overcome before complete British control of lower Burma could be established. Third Burma War (1885) After the death of Burmese King Bhindan, his son Thibaw succeeded to the throne. Thibaw, from the beginning itself, was hostile towards the British. The British merchants at Rangoon and lower Burma 

nflict with the French in Niger, Egypt, and Madagascar. A humiliating fine had been imposed on a British timber company by Thibaw. Dufferin ordered the invasion and final annexation of upper Burma in 1885. [The British had to face a strong guerrilla uprising in the whole of Burma soon after, and a nationalist movement after the First World War. The Burmese nationalists joined hands with the Indian Nat

ional Congress. To weaken this link, Burma was separated from India in 1935. The Burmese  

 nationalist movement further intensified under U Aung San during the Second World War, which finally led to the independence of Burma on January 4, 1948.] Anglo-Tibetan Relations Tibet was ruled by a theocracy of Buddhist monks (lamas) under nominal suzerainty of China. The British efforts to establish friendly and commercial relations with Tibet had

band on a special mission to Tibet to oblige the Tibetans to come to an agreement. The Tibetans refused to negotiate and offered non-violent resistance. Younghusband pushed his way into Lhasa (August 1904) while the Dalai Lama fled. Treaty of Lhasa (1904) Younghusband dictated terms to the Tibetan officials which provided that: ● Tibet would pay an indemnity of 75 lakh rupees at the rate of one lakh r

 Russia, the treaty was revised reducing the indemnity from Rs 75 lakh to Rs 25 lakh and providing for evacuation of Chumbi valley after three years (the valley was actually evacuated only in January 1908). Significance Only China gained in the end out of the whole affair because the Anglo-Russian convention of 1907  

reased Russian influence in Persia replaced British influence and thwarted an English scheme for establishment of a new route by River Euphrates to India. Especially after the Treaty of Turkomanchai (1828), the English got alarmed about possible Russian plans regarding India. Soon, there was a search for a scientific frontier from the Indian side. Passes of the north-west seemed to hold the key to ent

er India. The need was felt for Afghanistan to be under control of a ruler who would be friendly to the British. Forward Policy of Auckland Auckland who came to India as the governor general in 1836, advocated a forward policy. This implied that the Company government in India itself had to take initiatives to protect the boundary of British India from a probable Russian attack. This objective w

ch the British government in India rejected. Dost Mohammed now turned to Russia and Persia for help. This prompted the British government to go ahead with the forward policy, and a Tripartite Treaty (1838) was entered into by the British, the Sikhs, and Shah Shuja (who had been deposed from the Afghan throne in 1809 and had been living since then as a British pensioner at Ludhiana). The treaty provide

 ● Shah Shuja recognise the Sikh ruler, Maharaja Ranjit Singh’s claims over the Afghan territories on the right bank of the River Indus. First Anglo-Afghan War (1839–42) Soon after the tripartite treaty of 1838, there came about a drastic change in the political situation of the region because of the removal of the original irritants—Persia lifted its siege of He

rat, and Russia recalled its envoy from Kabul. Nevertheless, the British decided to go ahead with their forward policy. This resulted in the First Afghan War (1839– 42). The British intention was to establish a permanent barrier against schemes of aggression from the north-west. An English army entered triumphantly into Kabul (August 1839) after a successful at

tack. Most of the tribes had already been won over by bribes. Dost Mohammed surrendered (1840), and Shah Shuja was made the Amir of Afghanistan. But Shah Shuja was unacceptable to the Afghans. As soon as the British withdrew, the Afghans rose in rebellion, killing the garrison commander in Ka

bul. The British were compelled to sign a treaty (1841) with the Afghan chiefs by which they agreed to evacuate Afghanistan and restore Dost Mohammed. But the English plan failed. Under a new expedition, the British re-occupied Kabul in September 1842, b

ecognised him as the independent ruler of Afghanistan. The First Afghan War cost India about 1.5 crore rupees and nearly 20,000 men. John Lawrence and the Policy of Masterly Inactivity John Lawrence (1864–69) started a policy of masterly inactivity, which was a reaction to the disasters of the First Afghan War and an outcome of practical common sense and an intimate knowledge of the frontier problem a

nd of Afghan passion for independence. Even when Dost Mohammed died in 1863, there was no interference in the war of succession. Lawrence’s policy rested on the fulfilment of two conditions:  

li established himself on the throne, Lawrence tried to cultivate friendship with him. Lytton and the Policy of Proud Reserve Lytton, a nominee of the Conservative government under Benjamin Disraeli (1874–80), became the Viceroy of India in 1876. He started a new foreign policy of ‘proud reserve’, which was aimed at having scientific frontiers and safeguarding ‘spheres of influence’. According to Lytt

on, the relations with Afghanistan could no longer be left ambiguous. Second Anglo-Afghan War (1870–80) Lytton made an offer of a favourable treaty to Sher Ali, but the Amir wanted friendship with both his powerful neighbours, Russia and British India, while keeping both of them at an arm’s length.

ans. Lytton was displeased, and when the Russians withdrew their envoy from Kabul, Lytton decided to invade Afghanistan. Sher Ali fled in face of the British invasion, and the Treaty of Gandamak (May 1879) was signed with Yakub Khan, the eldest son of Sher Ali. Treaty of Gandamak (May 1879) The treaty signed after the Second-Anglo Afghan War provided that: ● the Amir conduct his foreign policy with th

mberment of Afghanistan, but could not carry it out. Ripon abandoned this plan and decided on a policy of keeping Afghanistan as a buffer state. [After the First World War and the Russian Revolution (1917), the Afghans demanded full independence. Habibullah (who succeeded Abdur Rahman in 1901) was killed in 1919 and the new ruler Amamullah declared open war on the British. Peace came in 1921 when Afgh

 India and the North-West Frontier Successive Indian rulers tried to reach out to this region lying between the Indus and Afghanistan in their search for a scientific frontier. The conquest of Sindh (1843) and annexation of Punjab (1849) carried British boundaries beyond the Indus and brought them in contact with Baluch and Pathan tribes, who were mostly independent, but the Amir of Afghanistan claime

d nominal suzerainty over them. During 1891–92 the British occupation of Hunza and Nagar in Gilgit Valley, which were passes commanding communications with Chitral, alarmed Abdur Rahman (Amir of Afghanistan). A compromise was finally reached b

y drawing a boundary line known as Durand Line between Afghan and British territories. Amir received some districts, and his subsidy was increased. But the Durand Agreement (1893) failed to keep peace and soon there were tribal uprisings. To check these, a permanent British garrison was established at Chitral and troops posted to guard Malakand Pass, but tribal uprisings cont

inued till 1898. Curzon, the viceroy between 1899 and 1905, followed a policy of withdrawal and concentration. British troops withdrew from advanced posts, which were replaced by tribal levies, trained and commanded by British officers. He also encouraged th

of the lieutenant-governor of Punjab). Overall, Curzon’s policies resulted in a peaceful north-west frontier. The peaceful conditions continued thereafter with occasional tribal uprisings. In January 1932, it was announced that the NWFP was to be constituted as a governor’s province. Since 1947, the province belongs to Pakistan.

 CHAPTER 6 People's Resistance Against British Before 1857 Most of us think of the 1857 Revolt as the first major show of resentment against the British who were represented by the rule of the East India Company. However, there were many incidents before the 1857 revolt that indicated a

The agitation in Benares in 1810 against a house tax imposed by the colonial government, the Surat riots in 1814 against the salt duty, the rising in Bareilly in 1816 against police tax and municipal taxes, are some examples of urba

Important Civil Uprisings Sanyasi Revolt (1763–1800) The disastrous famine of 1770 and the harsh economic order of the British compelled a group of sanyasis in Eastern India to fight the British yoke.

wrote a novel, Devi Chaudhurani, as he saw the importance of women too taking up the struggle against an alien rule that posed a threat to traditional Indian values. Revolt in Midnapore and Dhalbhum (1766–74) The English took hold of Midnapore in 1760 and at that time there were about 3,000 zamindars and talukdars having cordial relations with their ryots. But this harmonious scenario changed after th

e introduction of new land revenue system by the English in 1772. According to the British governor Vansittart, the zamindars of Midnapore sided with the ryots in case of conflict between the ryots and the English revenuecollecting officials. The zamindars of Dhal

bhum, Manbhum, Raipur, Panchet, Jhatibuni, Karnagarh, and Bagri, living in the vast tract of Jungle Mahals of west and north-west Midnapore—were ultimately dispossessed of their zamindaries by 1800s. The important leaders of the uprisings were Damodar Singh and Jagannath Dhal. Revolt of Moamarias (1769–99) The revolt of the Moamarias in 1769 was a potent challenge to the authority of Ahom kings

 of Assam. The Moamarias were low-caste peasants who followed the teachings of Aniruddhadeva (1553–1624), and their rise was similar to that of other low-caste groups in North India. Their revolts weakened the Ahoms and opened the doors for others to attack the region, for instance, in 1792, the King o

 Civil Uprisings in Gorakhpur, Basti, and Bahraich (1781) Warren Hastings, in order to meet the war expenses against the Marathas and Mysore, made a plan to earn money by involving English officers as izaradars (revenue farmers) in Awadh. He involved Major

 Alexander Hannay, who was well acquainted with the region, as an izaradar in 1778. Hannay secured the izara of Gorakhpur and Bahraich to the amount of 22 lakh rupees for one year. In fact, it was a secret experiment by the Company to see for itself just how much surplus money was 

ppression and excessive demand of revenue made the region, which had been in a flourishing state under the Nawab, panic-striken. The zamindars and cultivators rose against the unbearable exactions in 1781, and, within weeks of the initial uprising, all of Hannay’s subordinates were either killed or besieged by zamindari guerilla forces. Although the rebellion was suppressed, Hannay was dismissed and h

is izara forcibly removed. Revolt of Raja of Vizianagaram (1794) In 1758, a treaty was made between the English and Ananda Gajapatiraju, the ruler of Vizianagaram, to jointly oust the French from the Northern Circars. In this mission they were successful, but the English,

ram, and asked him to disband his troops. This angered the raja as there were no dues to be paid to the Company. The raja supported by his subjects rose up in revolt. The English captured the raja in 1793 and ordered him to go into exile with a pension. The raja refused. The raja died in a battle at Padmanabham (in modern Visakhapatnam district in Andhra Pradesh) in 1794. Vizianagaram came under the C

ompany’s rule. Later, the Company offered the estate to the deceased raja’s son and reduced the demand for presents. Revolt of Dhundia in Bednur (1799–1800) After the conquest of Mysore in 1799, the English had to confront many native leaders. Dhundia Wagh, a local Maratha

released with the fall of Seringapatam. Very soon, Dhundia organised a force, which consisted of anti-British elements, and carved out a small territory for himself. A defeat by the English in August 1799 forced him to take refuge in Maratha region from where he instigated the disappointed princes to fight against the English and he himself took on the leadership. In September 1800, he was killed whil

e fighting against the British forces under Wellesley. Though Dhundia failed, he became a venerated leader of the masses. Resistance of Kerala Varma Pazhassi Raja (1797; 1800–05) Kerala Varma Pazhassi Raja, popularly known as Kerala Simham (Lion of Kerala) or ‘Pyche raja’, was the de facto head of Kottayam (Cotiote) in Malabar region. Apart from resisting Hyder Ali and Ti

pu Sultan, Kerala Varma fought against the British between 1793 and 1805. The Third Anglo-Mysore War (1790–92) extended English paramountcy over Kottayam in violation of an earlier agreement of 1790 which had recognised the independence of Kottayam. The English appointed Vira Varma, the uncle of Pazhassi Raja, as the Raja of Kottayam. The new raja, to meet the revenue target fixed by the Company

, levied exorbitant rates of tax on the peasants. This led to a mass resistance by the peasants under the leadership of Pazhassi Raja in 1793. Pazhassi Raja fought bravely using guerilla warfare, and, in 1797, a peace treaty was made. But a conflict over a dispute on Wayanad in 1800 started an insurgent warfare. Pazhassi Raja organised a l

arge force of Nairs which was supplemented by Mappilas and Pathans, the latter being demobilised soldiers of Tipu who had become unemployed after Tipu’s death. In November 1805, the Kerala Simham died in a gunfight at Mavila Todu near present-day Kerala- Karnataka border. Civil Rebellion in Awadh (1799) Wazir Ali Khan, the fourth Nawab of Awadh, with the help of the British

, had ascended the throne in September 1797. But, very soon, his relations with the British became sour  

 and he got replaced by his uncle, Saadat Ali Khan II. Wazir Ali Khan was granted a pension in Benares. However, in January 1799, he killed a British resident, George Frederick Cherry, who had invited him to lunch. Wazir Ali’s guards killed two other Europeans and even attacked the Magistrate of Benares. The whole incident bec

pur. Arthur Wellesley requested the Raja of Jaipur to extradite Wazir Ali. Wazir Ali was extradited on the condition that he would neither be hanged nor be put in fetters. After surrender in December 1799, he was placed in confinement at Fort William, Calcutta. Uprisings in Ganjam and Gumsur (1800, 1835–37) In the Northern Circars, Ganjam and its adjoining regions rose in revolt against the British ru

le. Strikara Bhanj, a zamindar of Gumsur in Ganjam district, refused to pay revenues in 1797. In 1800, he openly rebelled and defied the public authorities. Snodgrass, an oppressive and corrupt collector, was replaced to suppress the insurrection. Strikara was joined by Jlani Deo of Vizianagar (Podda

kimedi) and Jagannath Deo of Pratapgiri (Chinakimedi). In 1804, Jagannath Deo was captured and sent to Masulipatnam. But the English had to assign certain districts to Strikara Bhanj. In 1807– 08, Dhananjaya Bhanj, son of Strikara, forced his father to leave the estate. Dhananjaya rebelled against the English but was forced to surrender in June 1815. Strikara, who had returned to Ganjam, 

was reappointed as the zamindar in a compromise with the government. He managed the estate between 1819 and 1830 but, failing to liquidate the arrears, retired in favour of his son, Dhananjay. However, unable to pay the enormous arrears, Dhananjay Bhanj rose in rebellion for the second time when the British for

ces occupied Gumsur and Kolaida in November 1835. The revolt greatly reduced the government’s authority, but Dhananjay died in December 1835 and his followers continued the resistance. The government appointed Russell, with full discretionary powers, to deal with the situation. The struggle  

People’s Resistance Against British Before 1857 ✫ 145

 lasted till February 1837, when Doora Bisayi, a formidable leader, was arrested. The zamindari of Gumsur was forfeited. Uprisings in Palamau (1800–02) The political situation of Palamau was complicated by the crises of agrarian landlordism and feudal system. In 1800, Bhukhan Singh, a Chero chief, rose in rebellion. Colonel Jones camped for two 

years in Palamau and Sarguja to suppress the rebellion. Bhukhan Singh died in 1802, and, subsequently, the insurrection calmed down. Poligars’ Revolt (1795–1805) The poligars (or palayakkarargal) of South India gave a stiff resistance to the British between 1795 and 1805. The main centres of these strong uprisings were Tinneveli (or Thirunelveli), Ramanathap

uram, Sivaganga, Sivagiri, Madurai, and North Arcot. The problem started in 1781, when the Nawab of Arcot gave the management and control of Tinneveli and the Carnatic Provinces to the East India Company. This arrangement caused resentment among the poligars who had, for long, co

er taxation, but had a larger political dimension in that the English considered and treated the poligars as enemies. Kattabomman Nayakan, the poligar of Panjalankurichi, led the insurrection between 1795 and 1799. After a fierce battle in which the Company forces were defeated by Veerapandiya Kattabomman, a price was put on the latter’s head. This led to greater rebellion by the poligars. With reinfo

 previous one, started in February 1801 when the poligars imprisoned in the fort of Palamcotta were able to escape. The rebels took control of many forts and even captured Tuticorin. The British forces were soon reinforced from Malabar. Th

e fugitives led by Oomathurai, brother of Kattabomman, who fled to Sivaganga in Ramnad joined the rebellion of the ‘Marudus’ led by Marathu Pandian which was suppressed in October 1801. The fort of Panjalankurichi was razed to the ground and the name of the place was expunged from all the documents of the district. Meanwhile, the nawab surrendered the civil and military administrat

ion of all the territories and dependencies of the Carnatic exclusively to the Company in perpetuity. Between 1803 and 1805, the poligars of North Arcot rose in rebellion, when they were deprived of their right to collect the kaval fees. (Kaval or ‘watch’ was an ancient institution of Tamil Nadu. It was a hereditary villa

the palayams of Chittur and Chandragiri. The poligar of Yedaragunta, who proved most daring and desperate among the insurgent chiefs, was joined by the dispossessed poligar of Charagallu. By February 1805, the rebels were suppressed. Several chiefs were ordered to reside in Madras, while some others were granted an allowance of 18 per cent upon revenues of their estates. The poligar rebellion spread o

of South India. The proclamations by the rebels, says A. Shunmugaiah, indicate that they believed in a mass movement against the alien rule, seeking independence of them. Uprisings in Haryana Region (1803-1810) The region of the present-day Haryana, with other possessions of Scindia, was taken over by the British East India Company by the treaty of Surji-Arjungaon in 1803. But the people of this regio

The British were victorious in all the battles during this expedition. The people of the region comprising Rohtak, Bhiwani, and the eastern part of Hisar were n

The British Resident at Delhi, Archibald Seton, sent a big force under the charge of Gardiner, Assistant to the Resident at Delhi in March 1810 to subdue the rebelling people, mainly Jats and Ranghars. The people of Bhiwani managed to check the advance of the British for a short while, but the British with their heavy artillery breached the 

walls of the town and soon captured Bhiwani after a bloody battle. The fort of Hansi was converted into a military cantonment. Diwan Velu Thampi’s Revolt (1808–09) The East India Company’s harsh conditions imposed on the state of Travancore, after both of them agreed to a subsidiary alliance arrangement under Wellesley in 1805, caused deep resentment in the

raja of Travancore had not wholly supported the rebellion and defected to the side of the Company. Velu Thampi killed himself to avoid capture. The rebellion petered out. Disturbances in Bundelkhand (1808–12) The vast province of Bundelkhand, conquered by the British during the Second Anglo-Maratha Wars (1803–05), was put within the Presidency of Bengal. The Bundela chiefs offered resistance to the ne

 150. The first major resistance came from Lakshaman Dawa, the killadar (fort commander) of Ajaygarh Fort. Lakshman was permitted to retain the fort as a temporary arrangement for two years ending in 1808, but he wanted to continue his hold after the expiry of the term. He surrendered in February 1809 and was taken to Calcutta. The next resistance came from Killadar of Kalanjar, Darya Singh, which was

 suppressed in January 1812. But the most serious threat came from a famous military adventurer named Gopal Singh, who had a dispute with his uncle who was supported by the British. For four years, Gopal Singh eluded all vigila

o put a stop to these disturbances, the British had to adopt a policy of binding down the hereditary chieftains of Bundelkhand by a series of contractual obligations—Ikarnamahs. Parlakimedi Outbreak (1813–34) Parlakimedi, situated in the western border of Ganjam district (now in Odisha), witnessed resistance from the zamindars and rajas. When the Company acquired Ganjam, Narayan Deo was the raja of Pa

rlakimedi, whose resistance forced the British to dispatch an army under Colonel Peach. Peach defeated Narayan Deo in 1768 and made Gajapathi Deo (son of Narayan) a zamindar. But Narayan Deo, supported by his son and brothers, revolted again. As the resistance failed to calm down, the Presidency of Madras appointed Georg

e Russell as commissioner of the region in 1832. Russell, provided with full-fledged powers to suppress the revolt, pacified the region by 1834. Kutch or Cutch Rebellion (1816–32) There was a treaty between the British and Maharaja Bharamal II of Kutch in 1816, by which power was vested in the throne. There was, however, a power struggle between the maharaja and a group of

 chieftains. The British interfered in the internal feuds of the Kutch and, in 1819, Raja Bharmal II raised Arab and African troops with the firm intention of removing the British from his territory. The chieftains ranged on his side. The British defeated and deposed the Kutch ruler

mand the restoration of Bharamal II. After extensive military operations failed to control the situation, the Company’s authorities were compelled to follow a conciliatory policy. Rising at Bareilly (1816) The immediate cause of upsurge was the imposition of the police tax which aroused the burning indignation of the citizens. The issue became religious when Mufti Muhammad Aiwaz, a venerated old man, 

gave a petition to the magistrate of the town in March 1816. The situation aggravated further when the police, while collecting tax, injured a woman. This event led to a bloody scuffle between the followers of the Mufti and the police. Within two days of the 

event, several armed Muslims from Pilibhit, Shahjahanpur, and Rampur rose in rebellion for the defence of the faith and the Mufti. In April 1816, the insurgents murdered the son of Leycester (judge of provincial court of Bareilly). The uprising could only be suppressed with heavy deployment of military forces in which more than 300 rebels wer

imprisoned. The upsurge seems to have been the product more of discontent than of actual grievance—the elements of discontent lying in the very nature of the alien administration. Upsurge in Hathras (1817) Dayaram, a talukdar of several villages in the district of Aligarh, had a strong base in the fort of Hathras. The fort, considered to be among the strongest in India—a ‘second Bharatpur’—had walls o

 committed many acts of hostility by giving harbour to government fugitives. So, the Company with a large army attacked Hathras in February 1817. Dayaram fought bravely for more than 15 days and escaped unharmed. But, ultimately, he was obliged to come back on the condition of submission and settled down with a pension. Another noted rebel Bh

agwant Singh, Raja of Mursan, frightened to dismantle his fort, submitted to the government. Paika Rebellion (1817) The Paiks of Odisha were the traditional landed militia (‘foot soldiers’ literally) and enjoyed rent-free land tenures for their military service and policing functions on a hereditary basis. The En

glish Company’s conquest of Odisha in 1803, and the dethronement of the Raja of Khurda had greatly reduced the power and prestige of the Paiks. Further, the extortionist land revenue policy of the Company caused resentment among zamindars and

es imposed on it, abolition of cowrie currency, and the requirement of payment of taxes in silver, etc. Bakshi Jagabandhu Bidyadhar had been the military chief of the forces of the Raja of Khurda. In 1814, Jagabandhu’s ancestral estate of Killa Rorang was taken over by the Company, reducing him to penury. The spark was lighted by the arrival of a body of Khonds from Gumsur into the Khurda territory in

 March 1817. With active support of Mukunda Deva, the last Raja of Khurda, and other zamindars of the region, Bakshi Jagabandhu Bidyadhar led a sundry army of Paikas forcing the East India Company forces to retr

 the British government for some time. Jagabandhu, declared an outlaw, along with other rebels, was sheltered by the Raja of Nayagarh. Although Dinabandhu Santra and his group surrendered in November 1818, Jagabandhu evaded British vigilance. In spite of rewards offered, none of the people of the province betrayed their leaders. Though Khurda was back under Company control by mid-1817, the Paika rebel

 resorted to guerilla tactics. The rebellion was brutally repressed by 1818. Priests at the Puri temple who had sheltered Jagabandhu were caught and hanged. Paikas on the whole suffered greatly. In 1825, Jagabandhu surrendered under negotiated terms. (Some sources say he was captured and died in captivity in 1829.) The Paika Rebellion succeeded in getting large remissions of arrears, reductions in a

ssessments, suspension of the sale of the estates of defaulters at discretion, a new settlement on fixed tenures, and other adjuncts of a liberal governance. Waghera Rising (1818–20) Resentment against the alien rule, coupled with the exactions of the Gaekwad of Baroda supported by the British government, compelled the Waghera chiefs of Okha Mandal to take up arms. The Wagher

as carried out inroads into British territory during 1818–19. A peace treaty was signed in November 1820. Ahom Revolt (1828) The British had pledged to withdraw from Assam after the First Burma War (1824–26). But, after the war, instead of withdrawing, the British attempted to incorporate the Ahoms’ territories in the Company’s dominion. This sparked off a rebellion in 1828 under the leadership of Go

, the Company decided to follow a conciliatory policy and handed over Upper Assam to Maharaja Purandar Singh Narendra and part of the kingdom was restored to the Assamese king. Surat Salt Agitations (1840s) A strong anti-British sentiment resulted in attacks by the local Surat population on the Europeans in 1844 over the issue of the government’s step to raise the salt duty from 50 paise to one rupee.

 Faced with a popular movement, the government withdrew the additional salt levy. Again in 1848, the government was forced to withdraw its measure to introduce Bengal Standard Weights and Measures in face of  

Savantvadi Revolts The Gadkaris were a hereditary military class which was garrisoned in the Maratha forts. These garrisons were disbanded during administrative reorganisation in Kolhapur state after 1844. Facing the spectre of unemployment, the Gadkaris rose in revolt and occupied the Samangarh and Bhudargarh forts. Similarly, the simmering discontent caused a revolt in Savantvadi areas. The people h

ere had already revolted against the British in 1830, 1836, and 1838, the last because the British had deposed their ruler. The British authorities introduced many laws to bring the region under control. Wahabi Movement The Wahabi Movement was essentially an Islamic r

evivalist movement founded by Syed Ahmed of Rai Bareilly who was inspired by the teachings of Abdul Wahab (1703–87) of Saudi Arabia and Shah Waliullah of Delhi. Syed Ahmed condemned the Western influence on Islam and advocated a return to pure Islam and society as it was in the Arabia of the Prophet’s time. Sy

to Dar al- Islam (the land of Islam), a jihad was declared against the Sikh kingdom of Punjab. After the defeat of the Sikh ruler and incorporation of Punjab into the East India Company’s dominion in 1849, the English dominion in India became the sole target of the Wahabis’ attacks. The Wahabis played an important role in spreading anti- British sentiments. A series of military operations by the Briti

sh in the 1860s on the Wahabi base in Sithana and various court cases of sedition on the Wahabis weakened the Wahabi resistance, although sporadic encounters with the authorities continued into the 1880s and 1890s.

 Kuka Movement The Kuka Movement was founded in 1840 by Bhagat Jawahar Mal (also called Sian Saheb) in western Punjab. A major leader of the movement after him was Baba Ram Singh. (He founded the Namdhari Sikh sect.) After the British took Punjab, the 

e Kukas, much before they became part of the Indian national movement in the early 20th century. As the movement gained in popularity, the British took several steps to crush it in the period between 1863 and 1872. In 1872, Ram Singh was deported to Rangoon. Peasant Movements with Religious Overtones Peasant uprisings were protests against evictions, increase in rents of land, and the moneylenders’ gr

r peasants among other things. They were revolts and rebellions of the peasants themselves though led by local leaders in many cases. The peasant movements in India till the outbreak of the Revolt of 1857 (and in its immediate aftermath) are given below. Narkelberia Uprising Mir Nithar Ali (1782–1831) or Titu Mir inspired the Muslim tenants in West Bengal to rise against landlords, mainly Hindu, who i

tribes of Mymensingh district (earlier in Bengal), was founded by Karam Shah. But the tribal peasants organised themselves under Karam Shah’s son, Tipu, to fight the oppression of the zamindars. From 1825 to 1835, the Pagal Panthis refused to pay rent above a certain limit and attacked the houses of zamindars. The government introduced an equitable arrangement to protect these peasants, but the moveme

founded by Haji Shariatullah of Faridpur in Eastern Bengal. They advocated radical religious, social, and political changes. Shariatullah and his son Muhsinuddin Ahmad, popularly known as Dudu Miyan (1819–62) organised their followers with an aim to expel the English intruders from Bengal. The sect also supported the cause of the tenants against the zamindars. The Faraizi disturbances continued from 1

838 to 1857. Most of the Faraizis joined the Wahabi ranks. Moplah Uprisings Hike in revenue demand and reduction of field size, coupled with the oppression of officials, resulted in widespread peasant unrest amo

ng the Moplahs of Malabar. Twenty-two rebellions took place between 1836 and 1854. None, however, proved successful. (The second Moplah uprising occurred after the Moplahs came to be organised by the Congress and the Khilafat supporters during the Non-Cooperation Movement. But Hin

du- Muslim differences distanced the Congress and the Moplahs from each other. By 1921, the Moplahs had been subdued.) Peasants’ Role in the 1857 Revolt Peasant participation was active only in some areas affected by the 1857 rebellion, mainly those in western Uttar Pradesh. Moreover, the peasants united with the local feudal leaders in many p

easants’ interests suffered. In Avadh, for instance, land was restored to the taluqdars and they were given revenue and other powers as well, and the peasants could not avail of the provisions of the 1859 Bengal Rent Act. As a punishment for their participation in the 1857 revolt, the peasants had to pay an additional cess in some regions. Tribal Revolts Tribal movements under British rule were the mo

r a longer time than the non-frontier tribal movements. De-sanskritisation movements also spread among the frontier tribals. The Meiteis organised a movement during Churchand Maharaja’s rule (between 1891 and 1941) to denounce the malpractices of the neo-Vaishnavite Brahmins. Sanskritisation movements were almost totally absent in the north-east frontier region in the colonial period. Characteristics

f settled agriculture, the area under forests and pastures was reduced, increasing the conflict between hill folk and settled cultivators. The Pahariyas now raided settled villages more often. In the 1770s, the British resorted to a brutal attack on the Pahariyas, aimed at hunting them down and killing them. The Pahariyas rebellion of 1778 led by Raja Jagganath is notable. In the 1780s, the British in

re that he organised had many Santhal women also participating in it. There were many encounters in the jungles of the Tarai region between Tilka Manjhi and his followers and the British soldiers. In 1778, Tilka is said to have taken the Ramgarh Camp from the British after forming a joint front with the Paharia Sardars. In 1784, Tilka led his followers to attack Bhagalpur; Tilka is said to have shot t

he British magistrate of Rajmahal, Augustus Cleveland. The British made a concerted attack on Manjhi and his followers, finally capturing Manjhi and hanging him in 1785. Manjhi is considered to be the first Adivasi leader to take up arms against the British. The main reason for the revolt led by Tilka was the  

People’s Resistance Against British Before 1857 ✫ 159

 policy of exploitation, extortion, and harassment by revenue collectors, police officers, and the agents of the landlords. Moreover, the drought of 1770 led to starvation in the region and consequent protests, a situation to which the British responded with more oppression. Jungle Mahal Revolt or the Chuar Uprising Jungle–or Jungal–Mahals is the name

his area came to be identified as made up of some parganas in Birbhum, Bankura, and Midnapore. (Because of the continued disturbances of the Bhumij, it was split amongst the neighbouring districts in 1833.) According to J.C. Jha, the Chuars were the Bhumij tribals belonging originally to the Mundari main stock. After moving away from the Chotanagpur plateau, they settled in large numbers in Midnapur, 

ntre. The first Chuar rebellion broke out as a reaction to the increase of the revenue of the jungle zamindars. The revenue was difficult to raise as the jungle territory yielded little. Moreover, in 1767, the British resident of Midnapur was instructed to demolish their mud forts, something that offended the zamindars. In 1768, Jagannath Singh, the zamindar of Ghatsila, (or  

 the king of Dhalbhum) went up in arms, along with thousands of Chuar followers. The Company government capitulated. In 1771, the Chuar sardars, Shyam Ganjan of Dhadka, Subla Singh of Kaliapal, and Dubraj rose in rebellion. This time, however, the rebellion was suppressed. The most significant uprising was under Durjan (or

 Durjol) Singh in 1798. The revenue and administrative policies of the East India Company (the Permanent Settlement being one of them) as well as the police regulations imposed in rural Bengal made the system of hiring loc

al paiks redundant as they came to be replaced by professional police. The aggrieved paiks and ordinary Chuars joined hands with the jungle zamindars in the Chuar rebellion of 1798. Durjan Singh was the zamindar of Raipur from which he was dispossessed owing to the operations of Bengal Regulations. In May 1798, his followers, a body of 1,500 Chuars, indulged in violent activiti

es in Raipur to halt the auction of the estate of Raipur. The revolt was brutally suppressed by the British in 1799. Other leaders of the Chuars were Madhab Singh, the brother of the raja of Barabhum; Raja Mohan Singh, zamindar of Juriah; and Lachman Singh of Dulma. All the people in the uprisings were somehow ass

sis). (The term ‘Chuar’ is considered derogatory by some historians who call this the Revolt of the Jungle Mahal, instead.) Tamar Revolt The tribals of Tamar (in Chotanagpur region) rose in revolt in 1798 under Bholanath Sahay. (In some sources, he is named Bholanath Singh.) The uprising was in reaction to the faulty and alien systems imposed by the British. The Munda

ith Bholanath. The revolt expressed anger against the diku. The uprising was firmly suppressed by an expedition led by Lt. Cooper. There were several more revolts by the tribals of Tamar. Kol Mutiny (1831) The Kols, alongwith other tribes, are inhabitants of Chhotanagpur. This covered Ranchi, Singhbhum, Hazaribagh, Palamau, and the western parts of Manbhum. The trouble in 1831 started with large-scale

ylenders who were oppressive and demanded heavy taxes. Besides, the British judicial and revenue policies badly affected the traditional social conditions of the Kols. The Kols resented this, and, in 1831, under the leadership of Buddho Bhagat, the Kol rebels killed or burnt about a thousand outsiders. Only after large-scale military operations could order be restored. Ho and Munda Uprisings (1820–37)

 The Raja of Parahat organised his Ho tribals to revolt against the occupation of Singhbhum (now in Jharkhand). The revolt continued till 1827 when the Ho tribals were forced to submit. However, later in 1831, they again organised a rebellion, joined by the Mundas of Chotanagpur, to protest against the newly introduced farming revenue polic

y and the entry of Bengalis into their region. Though the revolt was extinguished in 1832, the Ho operations continued till 1837. Nor were the Mundas to be quiet for long. The Santhal Rebellions (1833; 1855–56) It needs to be noted that the Santhals moved into the Rajmahal area in the late 1770s and early 1780s from the region of Cuttack, Dhalbhum, Manbhum, Hazaribagh, and Midnapore. They showed a

 Some Tribal Movements after 1857 Though this chapter is basically about the uprisings before the 1857 Revolt, it cannot be forgotten that some tribal revolts continued to take place after 1857. Some of these are discussed below. Bokta Rising, Sardari Larai, or Mukti Larai Movement Chotanagpur was the scene of this movement between 1858 and 1895. It was aimed at regaining the tribals’ age o

out the landlords. In the earlier phases of the revolt, the tribal tenants rose against the landlords because of the increased rent, eviction from land, and harassment by the landlords. Later, in the 1890s, the Sardar movement turned against all Europeans as they were suspected to be colluding with the landlords. British rule was perceived to be at the root of the problems faced by the tribals, theref

nal methods got little result, the tribals took to violence, using their traditional weapons such as bows and arrows. But the struggle lacked organisation and a good leader. Birsa Munda Revolt In the 1890s, Birsa Munda emerged at the head of a movement of the Munda tribes of SInghbhum and Ranchi districts of Chotanagpur region. The Ulgulan (‘Great Tumult’), as this movement was called, and which was a

e arrest and conviction of Birsa to two years of imprisonment by the British made the rebels more determined to go ahead with the movement which now took to violence. The revolt broke out in December 1899 and was directed against the dikus who included Christian missionaries as well as the much-hated landlords, contractors, police, and government officials. The British response was ruthless suppressio

n. Birsa was arrested in 1900 and died of illness. Many rebels who were arrested were imprisoned and sentenced to death. The movement was, thus, weakened.

lowing the Birsa Movement, the authorities felt that the interests of the tribals needed to be safeguarded. The government decided to abolish the compulsory begar system and passed the Tenancy Act of 1903 under which the Mundas’ Khuntkatti system was recognised. The Chotanagpur Tenancy Act was passed in 1908. Birsa assumed legendary fame, and his movement was an inspiration for the social, religious, 

and political movements of tribals in the future. Tana Bhagat Movement A young man, Jatra Oraon of Ranchi, proclaimed in April 1914 that he had been divinely ordained to become a king and his followers in his kingdom would be the Tana Bhagats. Tana Bhagats were called upon to discard earthly possessions such as agricultural imple

t worship and sacrifice. They sought to reorder the Oraon society. The Tana Bhagat Movement in the official history of the state of Jharkhand is represented as having been initiated by Jatra Oraon in 1914, and later led by Sibu Oraon in 1919. It was part of the agrarian discontent in Jharkhand against the imposition of begar and the illegal increase in rent by the zamindars and intermediary tenure-hol

s conducted a satyagraha even before Gandhi’s satyagraha movement. They differed from the movements led by Sido and Kanhu Murmu or Birsa Munda in that they were primarily religious and nonviolent. In 1921, during the Non-Cooperation Movement, the Tana Bhagats were drawn into the organisational fold of the Congress. Devi Movement The Devi movement was initially a social movement among the tribals of So

uth Gujarat in 1922-23. It was initiated by the assumption that Devi Salabai was commanding the tribals to abstain from eating flesh and drinking liquor and to wash and be clean. By December 1922, the movement spread over the region inhabited by the tribals as well as Surat city. This movement soon targeted those classes which exploited the tribals, such as landlords and moneylenders, and tho

se who were in the liquor trade. Towards the end of 1922, this movement became a part of the Non-Cooperation Movement. Santhals and the Paharias continued for a long time. (It has been called a battle between the hoe and the plough: the hoe symbolising the

 i-koh in 1832-33. (Damin-i-koh is a Persian term meaning the skirts – or outside edges – of the hills.) A portion of land at the foothills was declared to be that of the Santhals; they were to live and practise ag

forced to retreat into the higher hill tracts. Over time, the Santhals found that they were gradually losing the land they had worked on and brought under cultivation. The Permanent Settlement Act of 1793 proved to be disastrous for the agriculturists. The taxes levied by the Company government on their land was heavy and money had to be borrowed to pay off debts. But the diku moneylenders charged ver

y high rates of interest and, when debts remained unpaid, took possession of the land. Slowly, zamindars were taking over the Damin tracts. By the 1850s, the Santhals felt the need to rebel against the zamindars and the moneylenders. The rebellion soon turned into a movement against the British colonial state. The Santhals called the rebellion ‘hul’

articipated in the rebellion and are said to have entered the enemy camp under cover and killed several soldiers before they themselves died. The British suppressed the rebellion with a heavy hand by 1856, burning down villages or destroying them with the help of elephants, and killing thousands of Santhals. Sidhu and Kanhu were killed. It was after the Santhal Revolt of 1855-56 that the Santhal Parga

na was created out of the districts of Bhagalpur and Birbhum. The pargana was to have special laws within it. Khond Uprisings (1837–56) From 1837 to 1856, the Khonds of the hilly tracts extending from Odisha to the Srikakulam and Visakhapatnam districts

ibals to oppose the suppression of human sacrifice, new taxes, and the entry of zamindars into their areas. With Chakra Bisoi’s disappearance, the uprising came to an end. [A later Khond rebellion in 1914 in the Orissa region was triggered by the hope that foreign rule would end and they could gain an autonomous government.] Koya Revolts The Koyas of the eastern Godavari track (modern Andhra), joined 

by Khonda Sara chiefs, rebelled in 1803, 1840, 1845, 1858, 1861, and 1862. They rose once again in 1879–80 under Tomma Sora. Their complaints were oppression by police and moneylenders, new regulations, and denial of their customary rights over forest areas. After the death of Tomma Sora, another rebel

lion was organised in 1886 by Raja Anantayyar. Bhil Revolts The Bhils who lived in the Western Ghats controlled the mountain passes between the north and the Deccan. They revolted against Company rule in 1817–19, as they had t

o face famine, economic distress, and misgovernment. The British used both force and conciliatory efforts to control the uprising. However, the Bhils revolted again in 1825, 1831, and in 1846. Later, a reformer, Govind Guru, helped the Bhils of south Rajasthan (Banswara, Sunth states) to organise themselves to fight for a Bhil Raj by 1913. Koli Risings The Kolis living in the neighbourhoo

d of Bhils rose up in rebellion against the Company’s rule in 1829, 1839, and again during 1844–48. They resented the imposition of Company’s rule which brought with it large-scale unemployment for them and the dismantling of their forts. Ramosi Risings The Ramosis, the hill tribes of the Weste

 Singphos Rebellion The rebellion of the Singphos in Assam in early 1830 was immediately quelled, but they continued to organise revolts. An uprising in 1839 saw the death of the British political agent. Chief Nirang Phidu led an uprising in 1843, which involved an attack on the British garrison and the death of many soldiers. Some of the smaller movement

s were those of the Mishmis (in 1836); the Khampti rebellion in Assam between 1839 and 1842; and the Lushais’ revolt in 1842 and 1844, when they attacked villages in Manipur. Sepoy Mutinies A number of sporadic military uprisings took place before the Great Revolt of 1857 in different parts of the country. Causes There was rising d

refusal of the government to pay foreign service allowance while fighting in remote regions; (iv) religious objections of the high-caste Hindu sepoys to Lord Canning’s General Service Enlistment Act (1856) ordering all recruits to be ready for service both within and outside India. Further, the sepoys shared all the discontent and grievances—social, religious, and economic—that afflicted the civilian 

population. Over the years, the upper caste sepoys had found their religious beliefs in conflict with their service conditions. For example, in 1806, the replacement of the turban by a leather cockade caused a mutiny at Vellore. Similarly, in 1844, there was a mutinous outbreak of the Bengal army sepoys for being sent to far away Sind, and, in 18

 174 CHAPTER 7 The Revolt of 1857 In 1757, after the Battle of Plassey, the British laid the first step towards getting power in northern India. And in 1857 took place the major ‘Revolt’, which was a product of the character and policies of colonial rule after 1757, and after which noteworthy changes took place in the British policy of ruling over India.

However, the period between 1757 and 1857 was not all peaceful and trouble-free; it saw a series of sporadic popular outbursts in the

rebellions. Almost from the very early days of the East India Company’s rule, rebellions and uprisings occurred for various causes in different regions. Some of the movements continued even after the 1857 Revolt. Major revolts took place in the south, east, west, and the north-eastern regions which were suppressed with brutality by the Company. [The previous chapter discussed some of these uprisings.]

 The 1857 Revolt: the Major Causes The causes of the revolt of 1857, like those of earlier uprisings, emerged from all aspects—socio-cultural, economic, and political—of daily existence of Indian population cutting through all sections and classes. These causes are d

policies as of ‘Effective Control’, ‘Subsidiary Alliance’, and ‘Doctrine of Lapse’. The right of succession was denied to Hindu princes. The Mughals were humbled when, on Prince Faqiruddin’s death in 1856, whose succession had been recognised conditionally by Lord Dalhousie, Lord Canning announced that the next prince on View It was the British intruder who broke up the Indian handloom and destroyed t

d religious domains of the Indian society by outsiders. These fears were compounded by the government’s decision to tax mosque and temple lands and making laws such as the Religious Disabilities Act, 1856, which modified Hindu customs, for instance, declaring that a change of religion did not debar a son from inheriting the property of his ‘heathen’ father. Influence of Outside Events The revolt of 18

57 coincided with certain outside events in which the British suffered serious losses—the First Afghan War (1838–42), Punjab Wars (1845–49), and the Crimean Wars (1854–56). These had obvious psychological repercussions. The British were seen to be not so strong and it was felt that they could be defeated. Discontent Among Sepoys The conditions of service in the Com

were interpreted by Indian sepoys, who were generally conservative by nature, as interference in their religious affairs. To the religious Hindu of the time, crossing the seas meant loss of caste. In 1856, Lord Canning’s government passed the General Service Enlistment Act, which decreed that all future recruits to the Bengal Army would have to give an undertaking to serve anywhere their services migh

n. “The Army voiced grievances other than its own; and the movement spread beyond the Army”, observes S. Gopal. Finally, there had been a long history of revolts in the British Indian Army—in Bengal (1764), Vellore (1806), Barrackpore (1825), and during the Afghan Wars (1838–42) to mention just a few.

Starts at Meerut The revolt began at Meerut, 58 km from Delhi, on May 10, 1857 and then, gathering force rapidly, soon embraced a vast area from the Punjab in the north and the Narmada in the south to Bihar in the east and Rajputana in the west. Even before the Meerut incident,

 were rumblings of resentment in various cantonments. The 19th Native Infantry at Berhampore (West Bengal), which refused to use the newly introduced Enfield rifle and broke out in mutiny in February 1857, was disbanded in March 1857. A young sepoy of the 34th Native Infantry, Mangal Pande, went a step further and fired at the sergeant major of his unit at Barrackpore. He was overpowered and executed

At Bareilly, Khan Bahadur, a descendant of the former ruler of Rohilkhand, was placed

He emerged as one of the revolt’s acknowledged leaders once it broke out in Awadh in May 1857. The most outstanding leader of the revolt was Rani Laxmibai, who assumed the leadership of the sepoys at Jhansi. Lord Dalhousie, the governor general, had refused to allow her adopted son to succeed

The sacrifices made by the common masses were immense and innumerable. The name of Shah Mal, a local villager in Pargana Baraut (Baghpat, Uttar Pradesh), is most notable. He organised the headmen an

Unfortunately, in July 1857, Shah Mal was killed by an English officer, Dunlap. It is alleged that Shah Mal’s body was cut into pieces and his head displayed on July 21, 1857 to terrify the public. For more than a year, however

, the rebels carried on their struggle against heavy odds. Suppression of the Revolt The revolt was finally suppressed. The British captured Delhi on September 20, 1857 after prolonged and bitter fighting. John Nicholson, the leader of the siege, was badly wounded and later succumbed to his injuries. Bahadur Shah was taken prisoner. The royal princes were captured a

nd butchered on the spot, publicly shot at point-blank range by Lieutenant Hudson himself. The emperor was exiled to Rangoon where he died in 1862. Thus, the great House of Mughals was finally and completely extinguished. Terrible vengeance was wreaked  

 one, all the great leaders of the revolt fell. Military operations for the recapture of Kanpur were closely associated with the recovery of Lucknow. Sir Colin Campbell occupied Kanpur on December 6, 1857. Nana Saheb, defeated at Kanpur, escaped to Nepal in early 1859, never to be heard of again. His close associate Tantia Tope escaped into the jungles of central India, but was captured while asleep i

n April 1859 and put to death. The Rani of Jhansi had died on the battlefield earlier in June 1858. Jhansi was recaptured by Sir Hugh Rose. By 1859, Kunwar Singh, Bakht Khan, Khan Bahadur Khan of Bareilly, Rao Sahib (brother of Nana Saheb) and Maulvi Ahmadullah were all dead, while the Begum of Awadh was compelled to hide in Nepal. At Benaras, a

 rebellion had been organised which was mercilessly suppressed by Colonel Neill, who put to death all suspected rebels and even disorderly sepoys. By the end of 1859, British authority over India was fully re-established. The British government had to pour immense supplies of men, money, and arms into the country, though the Indians had to later repay the entire

ances and concepts of current politics. The lack of unity among Indians was perhaps unavoidable at this stage of Indian history. Modern nationalism was as yet unknown in India. In fact, the revolt of 1857 played an important role in bringing the Indian people together and imparting to them the consciousness of belonging to one country.  

st impulse of the Hindu sepoys at Meerut was to march to Delhi, the Mughal imperial capital. According to Maulana Azad, “Two facts stand out clearly in the midst of the tangled story of the Rising of 1857. The first is the remarkable sense of unity among the Hindus and the Muslims of India in this period. The other is the deep loyalty which the people felt for the Mughal Crown.” Rebels and sepoys, bot

resented in leadership, for instance Nana Saheb had Azimullah, a Muslim and an expert in political propaganda, as an aide, while Laxmibai had the solid support of Afghan soldiers. Thus, the events of 1857 demonstrated that the people and politics of India were not basically communal or sectarian before 1858. Nature of the Revolt Views differ on the nature of the 1857 revolt. It was a mere ‘Sepoy Mutin

e of the event as it involved many sections of the civilian population and not just the sepoys. The discontent of the sepoys was just one cause of the disturbance. Dr K. Datta considers the revolt of 1857 to have been “in the main a military outbreak, which was taken advantage of by certain discontented princes and landlords, whose interests had been affected by the new political order”. The last ment

 Datta, the movement was marked by absence of cohesion and unity of purpose among the various sections of the rebels. It was at the beginning of the 20th century that the 1857 revolt came to be interpreted as a “planned war of national independence”, by V.D. Savarkar in his book, The Indian War of Independence, 1857. Savarkar called the revolt the first war of Indian indep

first, nor national, nor a war of independence as large parts of the country remained unaffected and many sections of the people took no part in the upsurge. According to some Marxist historians, the 1857 revolt was “the struggle of the soldier-peasant democratic combine against foreign as well as feudal bondage”. However, this view can be questioned in the light of the fact that the leaders of the re

volt themselves came from a feudal background. Jawaharlal Nehru considered the revolt of 1857 as essentially a feudal uprising though there were some nationalistic elements in it (Discovery of India). M.N. Roy felt the revolt was a last-ditch stand of feudalism against commercial capitalism. 

R.P. Dutt also saw the significance of the revolt of the peasantry against foreign domination even as he acknowledged it to be a defence of the old feudal order. The revolt of 1857 is not easy to categorise. While one can easily dismiss some views such as those of L.E.R. Rees, who considered it to be a war of fanatic religionists against Christians, or T.R. Holmes, who saw in i

not quite go so far as to accept it as a war for independence. It had seeds of nationalism and anti-imperialism, but the concept of common nationality and nationhood was not inherent to the revolt of 1857. It is doubtful if the separate communities that participated in the revolt did so because they felt a common nationhood. Furthermore, what of the southern section which  

d a personal interest to protect. However, as Dr Sen points out, national revolutions are mostly the work of a minority, with or without the active support of the masses. From that point of view, the 1857 rebellion can claim a national character. One may say that the revolt of 1857 was the first great struggle of Indians to throw off British rule. Even this view has been questioned by some historians 

bserves, the revolt was “the first combined attempt of many classes of people to challenge a foreign power. This is a real, if remote, approach to the freedom movement of India of a later age”. Views 1857 stands firmly in a historical continuum. Not of course it was the direct product of social forces blowing off the political crust but rather fortuitous conjuncture that laid these forces bane. Like 1

 that violence was to be eschewed in any struggle for freedom. The educated middle class, which was a growing section, did not believe in violence and preferred an orderly approach. But the Revolt of 1857 did establish local traditions of resistance to British rule which were to be of help in the course of the national struggle for freedom. Summary Revolt—a product of character and policies of colonia

on for social reform. To reach the masses, the reformers used the Indian languages to propagate their views. They used a variety of media—novels, dramas, poetry, short stories, the press, and, in the 1930s and later on, the cinema—to spread their opinions. Broadly, the social reform movements had a two-point agenda—fight for the betterment of status of women in  

ormers led by Raja Rammohan Roy, the government under Governor-General William Bentinck declared the practice of sati illegal and punishable by criminal courts as culpable homicide. The regulation of 1829 (Regulation XVII, A.D. 1829 of the Bengal Code) was applicable in the first instance to Bengal Presidency alone, but was extended in slightly modified forms to Madras and Bombay Presidencies in 1830.

 (Historians have observed that the practice of sati was sought to be banned in the regions under the control of the Portuguese, Dutch, and French in the early 16th century. In 1582, the Mughal emperor, Akbar is said to have issued orders that sati was not be coerced, and appointed inspectors to see that no widow was compelled to follow the custom.) Preventing Female Infanticide

ctice of murdering female infants immediately after their birth was a common practice among upper-class Bengalis and Rajputs who considered females to be an economic burden. The Bengal regulations of 1795 and 1804 declared infanticide illegal and equivalent to murder. An act passed in 1870 made it compulsory for parents to register the birth of all babies, and it provided for verification of female ch

ecrecy. Widow Remarriage The Brahmo Samaj had the issue of widow remarriage high on its agenda and did much to popularise it. But it was mainly due to the efforts of Pandit Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar (1820–91), the principal of Sanskrit College, Calcutta, that the Hindu Widows’ Remarriage  

 Act, 1856, was passed; it legalised marriage of widows and declared issues from such marriages as legitimate. Vidyasagar cited Vedic texts to prove that the Hindu religion sanctioned widow remarriage. Vishnu S

hastri Pandit founded the Widow Remarriage Association in the 1850s. Another prominent worker in this field was Karsandas Mulji who started the Satya Prakash in Gujarati in 1852 to advocate widow remarriage. Similar efforts were made by Professor D.K. Karve in western India and by Veerasalingam Pantulu in Madras. Karve himself married a widow in 1893. He dedicated his life t

ai were also vociferous advocates of widow remarriage and campaigned against widows being subjected to degrading practices. Controlling Child Marriage The Native Marriage Act (or Civil Marriage Act), 1872 signified legislative action in prohibiting child marriage. It had a limited impact as the act was not applicable to Hindus, Muslims, and other recognised faiths. The relentless efforts of a Parsi re

former, B.M. Malabari, were rewarded by the enactment of the Age of Consent Act (1891), which forbade the marriage of girls below the age of 12. The case of Rukhmabai pushed the reformers to get the Age of Consent Act passed. Rukhmabai Raut, who went on to become India’s first woman p

ch she continued with her education. When, after some 12 years of the marriage, Dadaji Bhikaji demanded that she join him as his wife, she refused. This led to the Dadaji Bhikaji vs Rukhmabai case of 1884. Dadaji petitioned the Bombay High Court for restitution of conjugal rights of a  

 married off in “helpless infancy” and hence could not be forced to join her husband. However, an appeal was sought against the judgement after many criticised it as diminishing Hindu customs and, in 1887, Pinhey’s decision was overturned by Chief Justice Sir Charles Sargent and Justice Farran. Rukhmabai was told to live with her husband. Rukhmabai declared that she would rather undergo any punishment

 Medical Officer in Surat. During her long and distinguished career in medicine, she continued writing against child marriage and women’s seclusion or purdah system.) The Child Marriage Restraint Act 1929, popularly known as the Sarda Act, which came into force in 1930, further pushed up the marriage age to 18 and 14 for boys and girls, respectively. (Harbilas Sarda was an Indian academic and judge, w

me Member of the Central Legislative Assembly from Ajmer-Merwara. He was a follower of Dayanand Saraswati and a member of the Arya Samaj.) In free India, the Child Marriage Restraint (Amendment) Act, 1978 raised the age of marriage for girls from 15 to 18 years and for boys from 18 to 21.  

 Education of Women The Christian missionaries were the first to set up the Calcutta Female Juvenile Society in 1819. The Bethune School, founded by J.E.D. Bethune, president of the Council of Education in Calcutta in 1849 was the first fruit of the powerful movement for women’s education that arose in the 1840s an

d 1850s. Pandit Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar was associated with no less than 35 girls’ schools in Bengal and is considered one of the pioneers of women’s education. Jagannath Shankarsheth ‘Nana’ and Bhau Daji

nkarshet, or Jagannath Shankar Seth) was one of the founders of the School Society and Native School of Bombay. (The school changed names a number of times: it became the Bombay Native Institution in 1824; in 1840, it became the Board of Education; and in 1856 it became the Elphinstone Educational Institution.) When Dr Wilson belonging to the Scottish was unable to get accommodation for a girls’ schoo

l, Nana provided accommodation for the school and even sent the female members of his family to the school in Girgaum. In 1856, the British government had announced some grant in aid to private institutions. Nana took advantage of this and started an English Marathi school in Girgaum. He contributed funds to the girl’s schoo

ge his wife Savitri to read and write. Later, impressed by the school for girls run by the American missionaries in Ahmednagar, he and his wife opened the first school for girls at Bhidewada, Pune in 1848. Not many were willing to teach in the school,  

help from the authorities. It was an ‘indigenous’ effort and that too by a non-brahmin, in the face of huge opposition from the orthodox sections of society. The Alexandra Society of Parsis opened in 1863 was aimed at educating Parsi girls. Incidentally, the first woman graduate of Bombay University was a Parsi woman, Cornelia Sorabji, in 1887. She later worked for equal opportunities for women in edu

nterprise of Indians themselves that encouraged women’s education. After Lord Dalhousie declared that female education must be given “frank and cordial support”, Charles Wood’s Despatch on Education (1854) laid great stress on the need for female education. In 1914, the Women’s Medical Service did a lot of work in training nurses and midwives. The Indian Women’s University set up by Professor D.K. Kar

ve in 1916 was one of the outstanding institutions imparting education to women. In the same year, Lady Hardinge Medical College was opened in Delhi. Health facilities began to be provided to women with the ope

ning of Dufferin hospitals in the 1880s. Participation in the swadeshi and anti-partition and the Home Rule movements during the opening decades of the 20th century was a major liberating experience for the otherwise home-centred Indian w

omen. After 1918, they faced lathis and bullets and were jailed during political processions, picketing, etc. They actively participated in trade union and kisan movements, or revolutionary movements.  

 They voted in, stood for, and got elected to various legislatures and local bodies. Sarojini Naidu went on to become the president of the Indian National Congress (1925) and later the governor of the United Provinces (1947–49). After 1920, aware and self-confident women led a women’s movement. Many organisations and institutions such as the All India Women’s Confere

nce (established in 1927) came up. Women’s Organisations In 1910, Sarla Devi Chaudhurani convened the first meeting of the Bharat Stree Mahamandal in Allahabad. Considered as the first major Indian women’s organisation set up by a woman, its objectives included pr

er, according to critics, the philanthropic style that was being followed by these women was that of upper-class English women. The All India Women’s Conference (AIWC), founded by Margaret Cousins in 1927, was perhaps the first women’s organisation with an egalitarian approach. Its first conference was held at Ferguson College, Pune. Important founding members included Maharani Chimnabai Gaekwad, Rani

ccident of birth or sex but by planned social distribution. For this purpose, the AIWC worked towards various legislative reforms before and after India’s independence, some examples being Sarda Act (1929), Hindu Women’s Right to Property Act (1937), Factory Act (1947), Hindu Marriage and Divorce Act (1954), Special Marriage Act (1954), Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act (1956), Hindu Adoption and Ma

intenance Act (1956), the Suppression of Immoral Traffic in Women Act (1958), Maternity Benefits Act (1961), Dowry Prohibition Act (1961), and Equal Remuneration Act (1958, 1976). Struggle Against Caste-Based Exploitation The later-Vedic conception of four-fold division of Hindu society got further subdivided into numerous sub-castes due to racial admixture, geographical exp

The caste divisions were diluted, although in a limited manner, because of mass participation in demonstrations, meetings and satyagraha struggles. The Congress governments in various provinces after 1937 did some useful work for the upliftment of the depressed classes; for instance, free education for Harijans (‘untouchables’) was introduced in some provinces. The rulers of states like Travancore, In

rounds of humanism and reason. He argued that the Shastras did not sanction untouchability and, even if they did, they should be ignored since truth cannot be confined within the covers of a book. In 1932, he founded the All India Harijan Sangh. ● With increasing opportunities of education and general awakening, there were stirrings among the lower castes themselves. This awakening gradually developed

as Walangkar’s Vital Vidhwansak. Babasaheb Ambedkar, who had experienced the worst form of casteist discrimination during his childhood, fought against upper-caste tyranny throughout his life. In the 1920s, Ambedkar started a fortnightly newspaper, Mooknayak (Leader of the Voiceless) in 1920. He stated in the Mooknayak that a nationalist consciousness could not develop if social divisions were ignored

. The newspaper presented the sufferings of the untouchables in the context of the caste system. He also formed the Bahushkrit Hitakarani Sabha in 1924 with the motto of “educate, agitate and organise”, the focus being on mobilising the masses. It marked the beginning of a new socio-economic and political movement striving to bring about equality fo

r the oppressed classes. Another newspaper he started with the aim of defending the rights of the depressed classes was Bahishkrit Bharat (1927). Ambedkar organised the All India Scheduled Castes Federation in 1942, while several other leaders of the depressed classes had founded the All India Depressed Classes Association in the 1920s. Ambe

 Others in the 1900s, such as the Maharaja of Kolhapur, encouraged the non-brahmin movement which spread to the southern states in the first decade of the 20th century and was joined by the Kammas, Reddis, Vellalas (the

 powerful intermediate castes), and the Muslims. During the 1920s in South India, the non-brahmins organised the Self-Respect Movement led by E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker. There were numerous other movements demanding that the ban on the entry of lower castes into templ

an “one religion, one caste, one God for mankind”, which his disciple Sahadaran Ayyapan changed into “no religion, no caste, no God for mankind”. Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar led the Mahad Satyagraha in March 1927 to challenge the regressive customs of the caste Hindus. He stressed the necessity of removing ideas of ‘high’ and ‘low’ and inculcating self-elevation through self-help, self-respect, and self-knowl

Later, in December 1927, Ambedkar and his colleagues burnt the ‘Manusmriti’ at the same place as a gesture of getting rid of inequalities. Dr Ambedkar established the Bahishkrit Hitakarini Sabha in 1924 to highlight the dif

he institutions of the national life”.

 217 CHAPTER 9 A General Survey of Socio-Cultural Reform Movements and their Leaders Socio-Cultural Reform Movements and their Leaders Raja Rammohan Roy and Brahmo Samaj Raja Rammohan Roy (1772–1833), often called the the father of Indian Renaissance and the maker of Modern India, was a man of versatile genius. Rammohan Roy believed in the modern scientific approach and principles of human digni

ty and social equality. He put his faith in monotheism. He wrote Gift to Monotheists (1809) and translated into Bengali the Vedas and the five Upanishads to prove his conviction that ancient Hindu texts support monotheism. In 1814, he set up the Atmiya Sabha (or Society of Friends) in Calc

t, even a departure from the scriptures is justified. He said the principles of rationalism applied to other sects also, particularly to the elements of blind faith in them. In his Precepts of Jesus (1820), he tried to separate the moral and philosophical message of the New Testament, which he praised, from its miracle stories. He earned the wrath of missionaries over his advocacy to incorporate the m

sm. He stood for a creative and intellectual process of selecting the best from different cultures, over which, again, he faced orthodox reaction. Raja Rammohan Roy founded the Brahmo Sabha in August 1828; it was later renamed Brahmo Samaj. Through the Sabha he wanted to institutionalise his ideas and mission. The Samaj was committed to “the worship and adoration of the Eternal, Unsearchable, Immutabl

 Samaj propaganda. Roy’s death in 1833 was a setback for the Samaj’s mission. The features of Brahmo Samaj may be summed up in this way. ● It denounced polytheism and idol worship; ● It discarded faith in divine avataras (incarnations); ●

 be said to have had nationalist undertones. Raja Rammohan Roy’s Efforts at Social Reform Rammohan was a determined crusader against the inhuman practice of sati. He started his anti-sati struggle in 1818, and he cited sacred texts to prove his contention that no religion sanctioned the burning alive of widows, besides appealing to humanity, reason, and compassion. He also visited the cremation ground

s, organised vigilance groups, and filed counter petitions to the government during his struggle against sati. His efforts were rewarded by the Government Regulation in 1829, which declared the practice of sati a crime. As a campaigner for women’s rights, Roy condemned the general subjugation of women and opposed prevailing misconceptions which formed the basis of accord

e right of inheritance and property for women. Rammohan Roy did much to disseminate the benefits of modern education to his countrymen. He supported David Hare’s efforts to found the Hindu College in 1817, while Roy’s English school taught mechanics and Voltaire’s philosophy. In 1825, he established a Vedanta college where courses in both Indian learning and Western social and  

 Debendranath Tagore and Brahmo Samaj Maharishi Debendranath Tagore (1817–1905), father of Rabindranath Tagore and a product of the best in traditional Indian learning and Western thought, gave a new life to Brahmo Samaj and a definite form and shape to the theist movement, whe

n he joined the Samaj in 1842. Earlier, Tagore headed the Tattvabodhini Sabha (founded in 1839) which, along with its organ Tattvabodhini Patrika in Bengali, was devoted to the systematic study of India’s past with a rational outlook and to the propagation of Rammohan’s ideas. A new vitality a

cation, abolition of polygamy, improvement in ryots’ conditions, and temperance. Keshab Chandra Sen and the Brahmo Samaj The Brahmo Samaj experienced another phase of energy, when Keshab Chandra Sen (1838–84) was made the acharya by Debendranath Tagore soon after the former joined the Samaj in 1858. Keshab (also spelt Keshub) was instrumental in popularising the movement, and branches of the Samaj wer

 inter-caste marriages. Keshab Chandra Sen was dismissed from the office of acharya in 1865. Keshab and his followers founded the Brahmo Samaj of India in 1866, while Debendranath Tagore’s Samaj came to be known as the Adi Brahmo Samaj. In 1878, Keshab’s inexplicable act of getting his 13- year-old daughter married to the minor Hindu Maharaja of Cooch-Behar

ier, Keshab had begun to be considered as an incarnation by some of his followers, much to the dislike of his progressive followers. Further, Keshab had begun to be accused of authoritarianism. After 1878, the disgusted followers of Keshab set up a new organisation, the Sadharan Brahmo Samaj. The Sadharan Brahmo Samaj was started by Ananda Mohan Bose, Sib Chandra Deb, and Umeshchandra Dutta. It reiter

son, truth, and morality. A number of Brahmo centres were opened in Madras province. In Punjab, the Dayal Singh Trust sought to implant Brahmo ideas by the opening of Dayal Singh College at Lahore in 1910. Significance of the Brahmo Samaj In matters of social reform, the Samaj attacked many dogmas and superstitions. It condemned the prevailing Hindu prejudice against going abroad. It worked for a resp

 these matters it attained only limited success. The influence of the Brahmo Samaj, however, did not go much beyond Calcutta and, at most, Bengal. It did not have a lasting impact. Prarthana Samaj In 1867, Keshab Chandra Sen helped Atmaram Pandurang found the Prarthana Samaj in Bombay. Earlier, the Brahmo  

 precursor of the Prarthana Samaj was the Paramahansa Sabha, something like a secret society to spread liberal ideas and encourage the breakdown of caste and communal barriers. Mahadeo Govind Ranade (1842–1901), joined the samaj in 1870, and much of the popularity of and work done by the society was due to his efforts. His efforts made the samaj gain an all-India character. Other leaders of the samaj 

were R.G. Bhandarkar (1837– 1925) and N.G. Chandavarkar (1855–1923). The emphasis was on monotheism, but on the whole, the samaj was more concerned with social reforms than with religion. The Prarthana Sabha was very attached to the bhakti cult of Maharashtra. The s

nt as well as Widows’ Home Association with the aim of providing education and training to widows so that they could support themselves. Young Bengal Movement and Henry Vivian Derozio During the late 1820s and early 1830s, there emerged a radical, intellectual trend among the youth in Bengal, which came to be known as the ‘Young Bengal Movement’. A young Anglo-Indian, Henry Vivian Derozio (1809–31), w

ho taught at the Hindu College from 1826 to 1831, was the leader and inspirer of this progressive trend. Drawing inspiration from the great French Revolution, Derozio inspired his pupils to think freely and rationally, question all authority, love 

’s rights and education. Also, Derozio was perhaps the first nationalist poet of modern India. The Derozians, however, failed to have a long-term impact. Derozio was removed from the Hindu College in 1831 because of his radicalism. The main reason for their  

Vidyasagar The great scholar and reformer, Vidyasagar’s ideas were a happy blend of Indian and Western thought. He believed in high moral values, was a deep humanist, and was generous to the poor. In 1850, he became the principal of Sanskrit College. He was determined to break the priestly monopoly of scriptural knowledge, and for this he opened the Sanskrit College to non-brahmins. He introduced West

ch for the cause of women’s education. As government inspector of schools, he helped organise 35 girls’ schools many of which he ran at his own expense. As secretary of Bethune School (established in 1849), he was one of the pioneers of higher education for women in India.  

 The Bethune School, founded in Calcutta, was the result of the powerful movement for women’s education that arose in the 1840s and 1850s. The movement had to face great difficulties. The young students were shouted at and abused and, sometimes, even their parents subjected to social boycott. Many believed that girls who had received 

Western education would make slaves of their husbands. Balshastri Jambhekar Balshastri Jambhekar (1812–46) was a pioneer of social reform through journalism in Bombay; he attacked brahminical orthodoxy and tried to reform popular Hinduism. He started the newspaper Darpan in 1832. Known as the father o

f Marathi journalism, Jambhekar used the Darpan to awaken the people to awareness of social reforms, such as widow remarriage, and to instil in the masses a scientific approach to life. In 1840, he started Digdarshan, which published articles on scientific subjects as well as history. Jambhekar founded the Bombay Native General Library and started the Native Improvement Society of which an 

oot was the Students Literary and Scientific Library. He was the first professor of Hindi at the Elphinston College, besides being a director of the Colaba Observatory. Paramahansa Mandali Founded in 1849 in Maharashtra, the founders of the Paramahansa Mandali—Dadoba Pandurang, Mehtaji Durgaram and others—began as a secret society that worked to reform Hindu religion and society in general. The ideolo

 Jyotirao Phule and Savitribai Phule Jyotirao or Jyotiba Phule (1827–90), born in Satara, Maharashtra, belonged to the mali (gardener) community and organised a powerful movement against upper caste domination and brahminical supremacy. Phule founded the Satyashodhak 

Samaj (Truth Seekers’ Society) in 1873, with the leadership of the samaj coming from the backward classes, malis, telis, kunbis, saris, and dhangars. The main aims of the movement were (i) social service, and (ii) spread of education amon

sed communities as a class against those brahmins who used religion and the blind faith of the masses to exploit the masses for personal monetary gain. Jyotiba Phule was given the title of Mahatma in 1888 by another Maharashtrian social reformer, Vithalrao Krishnaji Vandekar. Jyotiba was not allowed to continue schooling because of his caste. However, with help and encouragement from the Persian schol

 Savitribai, were instrumental in opening a school for girls in Pune. The school syllabus included mathematics, science, and social studies. Savitribai, also of the mali community, was born in 1831 at Naigaon in Maharashtra’s Satara district and was married to Jyotiba Phule when a child of nine. Jyotiba, a firm believer in education for all, including women, taught his wife at home. Later, she 

anised a successful barbers’ strike to denounce the inhumane practice of shaving widows’ heads. With her husband, she set up a home called Balhatya Pratibandhak Griha (home to prevent infanticide) in 1863, where unwed mothers and widows who became pregnant under unfortunate circumstances could have safe deliveries instead of resorting to killing the infants or themselves. Savitribai is said to have or

their own water storage to everyone. After Jyotiba’s death, Savitribai took over the Satya Shodhak Samaj, presiding over the meetings, guiding the workers, and working for plague victims. She died in 1897, getting infected by the plague while caring for a patient.  

 Savitribai wrote poetry, and two of her collections are Kavyaphule and Bavankashi Subodh Ratnakar. (In August 2014, the name of the University of Pune was changed to Savitribai Phule Pune University in honour of Savitribai Phule.) Gopal Baba Walangkar Gopal Baba Walangkar, also known as Gopal Krishna, (circa 1840

–1900) was a pioneer in the cause of uplifting the Dalits from the socio-economic oppression that they suffered. Indeed, Walangkar is generally considered by Ambedkar to be the pioneer of the Dalit movemen

t. Born into a Mahar family near Mahad in what is now Raigad district of Maharashtra, Gopal Krishna served in the army till he retired in 1886. He was deeply influenced by Jyotiba Phule. Walangkar subscribed to Phule’s idea of the Aryan invasion theory, and said that the untouchable people of India were the indigenous inhabitants and that t

moval of Evils Among the Non-Aryans). It was through this society that a petition was sought to be raised against the policy of the government to discontinue the recruitment of Mahars in the army. In 1888, Walangkar began publishing the monthly journal Vital Vidhvansak (Destroyer of Brahmanical or Ceremonial Pollution). In 1889, he followed with a pamphlet, Vital Viduvansan (Annihilation of Ceremonial

s in it.” His approach was not so much a direct opposition to the elites of society; it was rather an appeal aimed at making them change their attitude. He also wrote Hindu Dharma Darpan published in 1894. He contributed to Marathi language journals such as Sudharak and Deenbandhu to arouse awareness and inspire the depressed classes. The attitude of the upper castes is manifest in the opposition they

 showed when Walangkar was appointed to the local taluk board of Mahad in 1895. Kisan Faguji Bansod Kisan Faguji Bansod (1879–1946) was born in a Mahar family at Mohapa village near Nagpur in Maharashtra. He wanted the Dalits boys and girls to be educated. He established the Chokhamela girls’ school at Nagpur. Setting up his own

 press in 1910, Bansod published the journals Nirashrit Hind Nagarik, Vital Vidhvansak, and Majur Patrika. He was one of the secretaries of the All India Depressed Classes Conference in 1920. Bansod was influenced by the Bhakti cult and the work of the Brahmo Samaj and the Prarthana Samaj. Though he also subscribed to the theory of the enslavement of the Dalits because of the Aryan invas

ion, he advocated reforms within Hinduism for the upliftment of the Dalits. Vitthal Ramji Shinde Maharshi Vitthal Ramji Shinde (1873–1944) was born in a Marathi family in Karnataka. He was influenced in his spiritual journey by the works of Tukaram, Eknath, and Ramdas. Brought up in a liberal intellectual atmosphere, he was also influe

r, G.B. Kotkar among other thinkers. He joined the Prarthana Samaj and worked towards the removal of untouchability in India. He established a night school for the children of untouchables in Pune in 1905. He established the Depressed Classes Mission in Bombay in 1906. The mission was aimed at trying to get rid of untouchability; to provide  

 educational facilities for the untouchables; and try to solve the problems of the untouchables. Shinde gave evidence before the Southborough Franchise Committee in 1919, and expressed the need for giving special representation to the untouchable class. He resigned as the executive of the Depressed Classes Mission when some of the members wanted the mission’s affairs

art in the Civil Disobedience Movement and was imprisoned in the Yerawda Central Jail. Shinde was the author of Bharatiya Asprushyatecha Prashna. Gopalhari Deshmukh ‘Lokahitawadi’ Gopalhari Deshmukh (1823–92) was a social reformer and rationalist from Maharashtra. He held the post of a judge under British raj, but wrote for a weekly Prabhakar under the pen name of Lokahitawadi on social reform issues.

n change religion.” He started a weekly, Hitechhu, and also played a leading role in founding the periodicals, Gyan Prakash, Indu Prakash, and Lokahitawadi. Gopal Ganesh Agarkar Gopal Ganesh Agarkar (1856–95) was an educationist and social reformer from Maharashtra. A strong advocate of the power of human reason, he criticised the blind dependence on tradition and false glorification of the past. He w

i, the journal started by Lokmanya Tilak. Later, he started his own periodical, Sudharak, which spoke against untouchability and the caste system. The Servants of India Society Gopal Krishna Gokhale (1866–1915), a liberal leader of the Indian National Congress, founded the Servants of India Society in 1905 with the help of M.G. Ranade. The aim of the society was to train national missionaries for the 

, by all constitutional means, the true interests of the Indian people; and to prepare a cadre of selfless workers who were to devote their lives to the cause of the country in a religious spirit. In 1911, the Hitavada began to be published to project the views of the society. The society chose to remain aloof from political activities and organisations like the Indian National Congress. After Gokhale

’s death (1915), Srinivasa Shastri took over as president. The society still continues to function, though with a shrunken base, at many places in India. It works in the field of education, providing ashram type of

cursions for slum dwellers, facilities for gymnasia and theatrical performances, sanitary work, medical relief, and boys’ clubs and scout corps. Joshi also founded the All India Trade Union Congress (1920). The Ramakrishna Movement and Swami Vivekananda The didactic nationalism of the Brahmo Samaj appealed more to the intellectual elite in Bengal, while the average Bengali  

 found more emotional satisfaction in the cult of bhakti and yoga. The teachings of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa (1836– 86), a poor priest at the Kali temple in Dakshineshwar, on the outskirts of Calcutta (who was known in childhood as Gadadhar Chattopadhyay) found many followers. Ramakrishna experienced spiritual tr

th his young monastic disciples as a nucleus to fulfil the first objective. The second objective was taken up by Swami Vivekananda after Ramakrishna’s death when he founded the Ramakrishna Mission in 1897. The headquarters of the Ramakrishna Math and Mission are at Belur near Calcutta. The two are twin organisations, though legally and financially separate Paramahamsa sought salvation through traditio

 as ‘holy mother’ that the disciples also knew her as. She played an important role in the work of the math and encouraging the young disciples in their mission. Swami Vivekananda Narendranath Datta (1862–1902), who later came to be known as Swami Vivekananda, spread Ramakrishna’s message and tried to reconcile it to the needs of contemporary Indian society. He emerged as the preacher of neo-Hinduism.

 have faith in themselves and strengthen their moral sense. He called upon his countrymen to imbibe a spirit of liberty, equality, and free thinking. At the Parliament of Religions held at Chicago in 1893, Swami Vivekananda made a great impression on people by his learned interpretations. The keynote of his opening address was the need for a healthy balance between spiritualism  

sm of the West and the spiritualism of the East into a new harmony to produce happiness for mankind. Vivekananda gave several lectures on Vedanta in the USA and in London before returning to India in 1897. In India he delivered a series of lectures, the focus of which were to infuse into the new generation a sense of pride in India’s past, a new faith in India’s culture, and a rare sense of confidence

 see the misery of the downtrodden and work for their uplift by the application of practical Vedanta principles. His emphasis was not only on personal salvation but also on social good and reform. In 1897, he founded the Ramakrishna Mission. Vivekananda was a great humanist and used the Ramakrishna Mission for humanitarian relief and social work. The Mission stands for religious and social reform. Viv

though it emphasises on the essential spirit and not the symbols or rituals. It believes that the philosophy of Vedanta will make a Christian a better Christian, and a Hindu a better Hindu. It was in 1898 that Swami Vivekananda acquired a large piece of land at Belur where the Ramakrishna Math was finally shifted and registered as such. The monastic order is open to all men without discrimination on t

yananda Saraswati and Arya Samaj The Arya Samaj Movement, revivalist in form though not in content, was the result of a reaction to Western influences. Its founder, Dayananda Saraswati or Mulshankar (1824–83) was born in the old Morvi state in Gujarat in a brahmin family. He wandered as an ascetic for 15 years (1845–60) in search of truth. The first Arya Samaj unit was formally set up by him at Bombay

 in 1875, and later the headquarters of the Samaj were established at Lahore. Dayananda’s views were published in his famous work, Satyarth Prakash (The True Exposition). His vision of India included a classl

Samaj came to be known for the social service it rendered in times of calamities such as earthquake, famine and floods. It also took initiative in promoting education. After the death of Dayananda in 1883, the work of the samaj was carried on by illustrious members. Education was an all-important field for the samaj. The Dayananda Anglo- Vedic (D.A.V.) College was established in 1886 at Lahore. But a 

that diet was a personal choice and it was not mentioned in the principles of the samaj; the Mahatma Party was in favour of all the Aryas being strict vegetarians. In the end, the Arya Samaj split in 1893 over these issues. The College Party retained control over the D.A.V. School and College, while the Arya Pratinidhi Sabha, Punjab, and a majority of the local Arya Samaj branches were taken over by t

he Mahatma Party. Swami Shraddhanand opened the Gurukul in 1900 at Gujaranwala (in West Punjab, now in Pakistan). In 1902, the Gurukul was moved to Kangri near Haridwar, hence the name, Gurukul Kangri. The gurukul aimed at providing an indigenous alternative to Lord Macaulay’s education policy by offering education in t

areas of vedic literature, Indian philosophy, Indian culture as well as modern sciences and research. The Gurukul believed in radical social reform. It founded the Kanya Mahavidyalaya at Jalandhar in 1896 and sponsored education for widows. The Arya Samaj was able to give self-respect and selfconfidence to the Hindus which helped to undermine the myth of superiority of whites and the Western culture. 

he shuddhi (purification) movement to reconvert to the Hindu fold the converts to Christianity and Islam. An aggressive campaign of shuddhi led to increasing communalisation of social life during the 1920s and later snowballed into communal political consciousness. The shuddhi movement also attempted to uplift those regarded as untouchables and outside the caste system of Hindus into pure caste Hindus

. Seva Sadan A Parsi social reformer, Behramji M. Malabari (1853–1912), founded the Seva Sadan in 1908 along with a friend, Diwan Dayaram Gidumal. Malabari spoke vigorously against child marriage and for widow remarriage among Hindus. It was his efforts that led to the Age of Consent Act, regulating t

society. It catered to all castes and provided the destitute women with education, and medical and welfare services. [Behramji Malabari acquired and edited the Indian Spectator.] Dev Samaj Founded in 1887 at Lahore by Shiv Narayan Agnihotri (1850– 1927), earlier a Brahmo follower, Dev Sadan is a religious and social reform society. The society emphasised on the eternity of the soul, the supremacy of t

n-vegetarian food, and keeping away from violent actions. Its teachings were compiled in a book, Deva Shastra. Agnihotri spoke against child marriage. Dharma Sabha Radhakant Deb founded this sabha in 1830. An orthodox society, it stood for the preservation of the status quo in socio-religious matters, opposing even the abolition of sati. However, it favoured the promotion of Western education, even fo

f orthodox Hinduism against the teachings of the Arya Samajists, the Theosophists, and the Ramakrishna Mission. Other organisations created to defend orthodox Hinduism were the Sanatana Dharma Sabha (1895), the Dharma Maha Parishad in South India, and Dharma Mahamandali in Bengal. These organisations combined in 1902 to form the single organisation of Bharat Dharma Mahamandala, with headquarters at Va

nal institutions, etc. Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya was a prominent figure in this movement. Radhaswami Movement Tulsi Ram, a banker from Agra, also known as Shiv Dayal Saheb, founded this movement in 1861. The Radhaswamis  

rma Paripalana (SNDP) Movement The SNDP movement was an example of a regional movement born out of conflict between the depressed classes and upper castes. It was started by Sree Narayana Guru Swamy (1856– 1928) among the Ezhavas of Kerala, who were a backward caste of toddy-tappers and were considered to be untouchables, and were denied education and entry into temples. The Ezhavas were the single la

erala constituting 26 per cent of the total population. Narayana Guru, himself from the Ezhava caste, took a stone from the Neyyar river and installed it as a Sivalinga at Aruvippuram on Sivaratri in 1888. It was intended to show that consecration of an idol was not the monopoly of the higher castes. With this, he began a revolution that soon led to the removal of many discriminations in Kerala’s soci

ety. The movement (Aruvippuram Movement) drew the famous poet Kumaran Asan as a disciple of Narayana Guru. In 1889, the Aruvippuram Kshetra Yogam was formed, which was decided to expand into a big organisation to help the Ezhavas to progress materially as well as spiritually. Thus, the Aruvippuram Sree Narayana G

uru Dharma Paripalana Yogam (in short SNDP) was registered in 1903 under the Indian Companies Act, with Narayana Guru as its permanent chairman, and Kumaran Asan as the general secretary. (In the formation of SNDP, the efforts of Dr Palpu must be acknowledged. He ha

Vokkaliga Sangha The Vokkaliga Sangha in Mysore launched an anti-brahmin movement in 1905. Justice Movement This movement in Madras Presidency was started by C.N. Mudaliar, T.M. Nair, and P. Tyagaraja to secure jobs and representation for the non-brahmins in the legislature. In 1917, Madr

iation was formed which demanded separate representation for the lower castes in the legislature. Self-Respect Movement This movement was started by E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker, a Balija Naidu, in the mid-1920s. The movement aimed at nothing short of a rejection of the brahminical religion and culture which Naicker felt was the prime instrument of exploitation of the lower castes. He sought to undermine th

 entry with the Travancore administration. Nothing transpired. In the meanwhile, Vaikom, in the northern part of Travancore, became a centre of agitation for temple entry. In 1924, the Vaikom Satyagraha, led by K.P. Kesava, was launched in Kerala demanding the throwing open of Hindu temples and roads to the untouchables. The satyagraha was reinforced by jathas from Punjab and 

Madurai. Gandhi undertook a tour of Kerala in support of the movement. Again, in 1931, when the Civil Disobedience Movement was suspended, temple entry movement was organised in Kerala. Inspired by K. Kelappan, poet Subramaniyam Tirumambu (the ‘singing sword of Kerala’) led a group of

 16 volunteers to Guruvayur. Leaders like P. Krishna Pillai and A.K. Gopalan were among the satyagrahis. Finally, on November 12, 1936, the Maharaja of Travancore issued a proclamation throwing open all government-controlled temples to all Hindus. A similar step was taken by the C. Rajagopalachari administration in Madras in 1938. I

ndian Social Conference Founded by M.G. Ranade and Raghunath Rao, the Indian Social Conference met annually from its first session in Madras in 1887 at the same time and venue as the Indian National Congress. It focused attention on the social issues of importance; it could be called the social reform cell of the Indian National Congress, in fact

. It launched the ‘Pledge Movement’ to inspire people to take a pledge against child marriage. Wahabi/Walliullah Movement The teachings of Abdul Wahab of Arabia and the preachings of Shah Walliullah (1702–63) inspired this essentially revivalist response to Western influences and the degeneration which had set in among Indian Muslims and called for a return to the true spirit of Islam. He was the firs

r-ul-Harb (land of the kafirs), and it needed to be converted to dar-ul-Islam (land of Islam). Initially, the movement was directed at the Sikhs in Punjab, but after the British annexation of Punjab (1849), the movement was directed against the British. During the 1857 Revolt, the Wahabi’s played an important role in spreading anti-British feelings. The Wahabi Movement fizzled out in the face of Briti

sh military might in the 1870s. Titu Mir’s Movement Syed Mir Nisar Ali, popularly known as Titu Mir, was a disciple of Syed Ahmad Barelvi (of Rae Bareilly), an adherent of the Wahabi movement. Titu Mir adopted Wahabism and advoca

he movement was not as militant as the British records made it out to be; only in the last year of Titu’s life was there a confrontation between him and the British police. He was killed in action in 1831. Faraizi Movement The movement, also called the Fara’idi Movement because of its emphasis on the Islamic pillars of faith, was founded by Haji Shariatullah in 1819. Its scene of action was East Benga

un-Islamic practices current among the Muslims of the region and draw their attention to their duties as Muslims. Under the leadership of Haji’s son, Dudu Mian, the movement became revolutionary from 1840 onwards. He gave the movement an organisational system from the village to the  

andlords too, besides the indigo planters. Dudu Mian asked his followers not to pay rent. The organisation even established its own law courts. Dudu Mian was arrested several times, and his arrest in 1847 finally weakened the movement. The movement survived merely as a religious movement without political overtones after the death of Dudu Mian in 1862. Ahmadiyya Movement The Ahmadiyya forms a sect of 

Islam which originated from India. It was founded by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad in 1889. It was based on liberal principles. It described itself as the standard-bearer of Mohammedan Renaissance, and based itself, like the Brahmo Samaj, on the principles of universal religion of all huma

e. However, the Ahmadiyya Movement, like Baha’ism which flourished in the West Asian countries, suffered from mysticism. Sir Syed Ahmed Khan and the Aligarh Movement The British view on the revolt of 1857 held the Muslims to be the main conspirators. This view was further strengthened by the activities of the Wahabis. But later, an opinion got currency among the rulers that the Muslims could be used a

esented, among others, by the foundation of the Indian National Congress. This was to be achieved through offers of thoughtful concessions to the Muslims. A section of Muslims led by Syed Ahmed Khan (1817–98) was ready to allow the official patronage to stimulate a process of growth  

rough better education and employment opportunities. Syed Ahmed Khan, born in a respectable Muslim family, was a loyalist member of the judicial service of the British government. After retirement in 1876, he became a member of the Imperial Legislative Council in 1878. His loyalty earned him a knighthood in 1888. He wanted to reconcile Western scientific education with the teachings of the Quran, whic

zealous educationist—as an official, he opened schools in towns, got books translated into Urdu, and started the Mohammedan Anglo-Oriental College (later, the Aligarh Muslim University) at Aligarh in 1875. He also struggled to bring about an improvement in the position of women through better education and by opposing purdah and polygamy, advocating easy divorce, and condemning the system of piri and 

and keeping alive the spirit of jihad against the foreign rulers. The Deoband Movement was begun at the Darul Uloom (or Islamic academic centre), Deoband, in Saharanpur district (United Provinces) in 1866 by Muhammad Qasim Nanautavi (1832–80) and Rashid Ahmad Gangohi (1828–1905) to train religious leaders for the Muslim community. In contrast to the Aligarh Movement, which aimed at the welfare of Musl

of the Muslim community. The instruction imparted at Deoband was in original Islamic religion. On the political front, the Deoband school welcomed the formation of the Indian National Congress and in 1888 issued a fatwa (religious decree) against Syed Ahmed Khan’s organisations, the United Patriotic Association and the Mohammaden Anglo-Oriental Association. Some critics attribute Deoband’s support to 

bli Numani, a supporter of the Deoband school, favoured the inclusion of English language and European sciences in the system of education. He founded the Nadwatal Ulama and Darul Uloom in Lucknow in 1894–96. He believed in the idealism of the Congress and cooperation between the Muslims and the Hindus of India to create a state in which both could live amicably. Parsi Reform Movements The Rahnumai Ma

zdayasnan Sabha (Religious Reform Association) was founded in 1851 by a group of Englisheducated Parsis for the “regeneration of the social conditions of the Parsis and the restoration of the Zoroastrian religion to its pristine purity”. The movement had Naoroji Fur

y. Sikh Reform Movements The Sikh community could not remain untouched by the rising tide of rationalist and progressive ideas of the 19th century. The Singh Sabha Movement was founded at Amritsar in 1873 with a two-fold objective: (i) to make available modern western education to the Sikhs, and (ii) to counter the proselytising activities of Christian missionaries as well as the Brahmo Samajists, Ary

e mahants were a loyalist and reactionary lot, enjoying government patronage. The government tried its repressive policies against the non-violent non-cooperation satyagraha launched by the Akalis in 1921, but had to bow before popular demands; it passed the Sikh Gurudwaras Act in 1922 (amended in 1925) which gave the control of gurudwaras to the Sikh masses to be administered through Shiromani Gurudw

 leaders played a notable role in the national liberation struggle though some dissenting voices were heard occasionally. The Theosophical Movement A group of westerners led by Madame H.P. Blavatsky (1831– 91) and Colonel M.S. Olcott, who were inspired by Indian thought and culture, founded the Theosophical Society in New York City, United States in 1875. In 1882, they shifted their headquarters to Ad

d marriage and advocated the abolition of caste discrimination, uplift of and improvement in the condition of widows. In India, the movement became somewhat popular with the election of Annie Besant (1847–1933) as its president after the death of Olcott in 1907. Annie Besant had come to India in 1893. She laid the foundation of the Central Hindu College in Benaras in 1898 where both Hindu religion and

 Western scientific subjects were taught. The college became the nucleus for the formation of Benaras Hindu University in 1916. Annie Besant also did much for the cause of the education of women. The Theosophical Society provided a common denominator for the various sects and fulfilled the urge of educated Hindus. However, t

half of the 19th century saw an unprecedented growth of Indian-owned English and vernacular newspapers, despite numerous restrictions imposed on the press by the colonial rulers from time to time. In 1877, there were about 169 newspapers published in vernacular languages and their circulation reached the neighbourhood of 1,00,000. The press while criticising official policies, on the one hand, urged t

 policy of discrimination and segregation. Indians felt deeply hurt by this. Lytton’s reactionary policies such as reduction of maximum age limit for the I.C.S. examination from 21 years to 19 years (1876), the grand Delhi Durbar of 1877 when the country was in the severe grip of famine, the Vernacular Press Act (1878), and the Arms Act (1878) provoked a storm of opposition in the country. Then came t

 Political Associations in Bengal The Bangabhasha Prakasika Sabha was formed in 1836 by associates of Raja Rammohan Roy. The Zamindari Association, more popularly known as the ‘Landholders’ Society’, was founded to safeguard the interests of the landlords. Although limited in its obj

olders’ Society marked the beginning of an organised political activity and use of methods of constitutional agitation for the redressal of grievances. The Bengal British India Society was founded in 1843 with the object of “the collection and dissemination of information relating to the actual condition of the people of British India... and to employ such other means of peaceful and lawful character 

as may appear calculated to secure the welfare, extend the just rights and advance the interests of all classes of our fellow subjects”. In 1851, both the Landholders’ Society and the Bengal British India Society merged into the British Indian Association. It sent a petition to the British Parliament demanding inclusion of some of its suggest

 of executive from judicial functions; (iii) reduction in salaries of higher officers; and (iv) abolition of salt duty, abkari, and stamp duties. These were partially accepted when the Charter Act of 1853 provided for the addition of six members to the governor general’s council for legislative purposes. The East India Association was organised by Dadabhai Naoroji in 1866 in London to discuss the Indi

an question and influence public men in England to promote Indian welfare. Later, branches of the association were started in prominent Indian cities. The Indian League was started in 1875 by Sisir Kumar Ghosh with the object of “stimulating the sense of nationalism amongst the people” and of encouraging political education. The Indian Association of Calcutta (also known as the Indian 

 League and was founded in 1876 by younger nationalists of Bengal led by Surendranath Banerjea and Ananda Mohan Bose, who were getting discontented with the conservative and pro-landlord policies of the British Indian Association. 

the people.” It set out to: (i) create a strong public opinion on political questions; and (ii) unify Indian people in a common political programme. It protested against the reduction of age limit in 1877 for candidates of the Indian Civil Service examination. The association demanded simultaneous holding of civil service examination in England and India and Indianisation of higher administrative post

he membership fee was kept low in order to attract the poorer sections to the association. The association sponsored an all-India conference which first took place in Calcutta from December 28 to 30, 1883. More than hundred delegates from different parts of the country attended. So, in a way, the association was a forerunner of the Indian National Congress as an all-India nationalist organisation. It 

later merged with the Indian National Congress in 1886. Political Associations in Bombay The Poona Sarvajanik Sabha was founded in 1867 by Mahadev Govind Ranade and others, with the object of serving as a bridge between the government and the people. The Bombay Presidency Association was started by Badruddin Tyabji, Pherozeshah Mehta

, and K.T. Telang in 1885. Political Associations in Madras The Madras Mahajan Sabha was founded in 1884 by M. Viraraghavachari (also, Veeraraghavachariar), B. Subramania Aiyer, and P. Ananda- charlu.  

 Pre-Congress Campaigns The associations organised various campaigns before the Indian National Congress appeared on the scene. These campaigns were: (i) for imposition of import duty on cotton (1875) (ii) for Indianisation of government service (1878–79) (iii) against Lytton’s Afghan adventure (iv) against Arms Act (1878) (v) against Vernacular Press Act (1878) (vi) for right to join volunteer c

 262 CHAPTER 11 Indian National Congress: Foundation and the Moderate Phase Foundation of the Indian National Congress In the later 1870s and early 1880s, a solid ground had been prepared for the establishment of an all-India organisation. The final shape to this idea was given by a retired English civil servant, A.O. Hume, who mobilised leading inte

llectuals of the time and, with their cooperation, organised the first session of the Indian National Congress at Gokuldas Tejpal Sanskrit College in Bombay in December 1885. As a prelude to this, two sessions of the Indian National Conference had been held in 1883 and 1885, which had representatives drawn from all major towns of India. Surendranath Banerjea and Ananda M

Other prominent leaders included Mahadev Govind Ranade, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Sisir Kumar Ghosh, Motilal Ghosh, Madan Mohan Malaviya, G. Subramania Aiyar, C. Vijayaraghavachariar, Dinshaw E. Wacha. In 1890, Kadambini Ganguly, the first woman graduate of Calcutta University, addressed the Congress session, which symbolised the commitment of the freedom struggle to give the women of India their due statu

ogramme; (vii) develop and consolidate a feeling of national unity among people irrespective of religion, caste, or province. (viii) carefully promote and nurture Indian nationhood. Era of Moderates (1885–1905) Important Leaders The national leaders like Dadabhai Naoroji, Pherozeshah Mehta, D.E. Wacha, W.C. Bonnerjea, S.N. Banerjea who dominated the Congress policies during the early period (1885–1905

A British committee of the Indian National Congress was established in London in 1889 which had India as its organ. Dadabhai Naoroji spent a substantial portion of his life and income campaigning for India’s case abroad. In 1890, it was decided to hold a session of the Indian National

 Congress in London in 1892, but owing to the British elections of 1891 the proposal was postponed and never revived later. The Moderate leaders believed that political connections with Britain were in India’s interest at that stage of history and that the time was not r

Constitutional Reforms and Propaganda in Legislature Legislative councils in India had no real official power till 1920. Yet, work done in them by the nationalists helped the growth of the national movement. The Imperial Legislative Council constituted by the Indian Councils Act (1861) was an impotent body designed to

 disguise official measures as having been passed by a representative body. Indian members were few in number—in the 30 years from 1862 to 1892 only 45 Indians were nominated to it, most of them being wealthy, landed, and with loyalist interests. Only a handful of political figures and independent intellectuals such as Syed Ahmed Khan, Krist

odas Pal, V.N. Mandlik, K.L. Nulkar, and Rashbehari Ghosh (also written as Rash Behari Ghose) were among those nominated. From 1885 to 1892, the nationalist demands for constitutional reforms were centred around: (i) expansion of councils—i.e., greater participation of Indians in councils; and (ii) reform of councils—i.e., more powers to

greater control over finances. The early nationalists worked with the long-term objective of a democratic self-government. Their demands for constitutional reforms were meant to have been conceded in 1892 in the form of the Indian Councils Act. These reforms were severely criticised at Congress sessions, where the nationalists made no secret of their dissatisfaction with them. Now, they demanded: (i) 

 slogan—“No taxation without representation”. Gradually, the scope of constitutional demands was widened. Dadabhai Naoroji (1904), Gopal Krishna Gokhale (1905), and Lokmanya Tilak (1906) demanded self-government on the lines of the self-governing colonies of Canada and Australia. Also, leaders like Pherozeshah Mehta and Gokhale put government policies and proposals to severe critici

vances, for exposing the defects of an indifferent bureaucracy, for criticising government policies/proposals, raising basic economic issues, especially regarding public finance. Indian Councils Act, 1892 Main Provisions ● Number of additional members in Imperial Legislative Councils and the Provincial Legislative Councils was raised. In Imperial Legislative Council, now the governor general could hav

be asked. Limitations ● The officials retained their majority in the council, thus making ineffective the non-official voice. ● The ‘reformed’ Imperial Legislative Council met, during its tenure till 1909, on an average for only 13 days in a year, and the number of unofficial Indian members present was only five out of twenty-four. ● The budget could not be voted upon, nor could any amendments be made

It was due to the increased consciousness that there was a great public outrage at the arrest of Tilak and several other leaders and journalists in 1897 and at the arrest and deportation of the Natu brothers without a trial.

 CHAPTER 12 Era of Militant Nationalism (1905–1909) Growth of Militant Nationalism A radical trend of a militant nationalist approach to political activity started emerging in the 1890s, and it took a concrete shape by 1905. As an adjunct to this trend, a revolutionary wing also took shape. Why Militant Nationalism Grew Many factors contributed to the rise of militant nationalism. 

Recognition of the True Nature of British Rule Having seen that the British government was not conceding any of their important demands, the more militant among 272 UNIT 6 National Movement (1905–1918) Chapters 12 to 14

re effective mode of political action. Also, the feeling that only an Indian government could lead India on to a path of progress started attracting more and more people. The economic miseries of the 1890s further exposed the exploitative character of colonial rule. Severe famines killed 90 lakh persons between 1896 and 1900. Bubonic plague affected large areas of the Deccan. There were largescale rio

ts in the Deccan. The nationalists were wide awake to the fact that instead of giving more rights to the Indians, the government was taking away even the existing ones. 1892— The Indian Councils Act was criticised by nationalists as it failed to satisfy them. 1897— The Natu brothers were deported without trial and Tilak and others, imprisoned on charges of sedition. 1898

— Repressive laws under IPC Section 124 A were further amplified with new provisions under IPC Section 156 A. 1899— The number of Indian members in Calcutta Corporation were reduced. 1904— Official Secrets Act curbed freedom of press. 1904— The Indian Universities Act ensured greater government control over universities, which it described as factories producing political revolutionar

tate of the country’s economy under colonial rule. This added to the already simmering discontent among the more radical nationalists. International Influences Remarkable progress made by Japan after 1868 and its emergence as an industrial power opened the eyes of Indians to the fact that economic progress was possible even in an Asian country without any external help. The defeat of the Italian army 

by Ethiopians (1896), the Boer wars (1899– 1902) where the British faced reverses, and Japan’s victory over Russia (1905) demolished myths of European invincibility. Also, the nationalists were inspired by the nationalist movements worldwide—in Ireland, Russia, Egypt, Turkey, Persia, and China. The Indians realised tha

Partition of Bengal to Divide People The British government’s decision to partition Bengal had been made public in December 1903. The idea was to have two provinces: Bengal comprising Western Bengal as well as the provinces of Bihar and Orissa, and Eastern Bengal, and Assam. Bengal retained Calcutta as its capital, while Dacca

Anti-Partition Campaign Under Moderates (1903–05) In the period 1903–05, the leadership was provided by men like Surendranath Banerjea, K.K. Mitra, and Prithwishchandra Ray. The methods adopted were petitions to the government, public meetings, 

a and England to prevent the unjust partition of Bengal from being implemented. Ignoring a loud public opinion against the partition proposal, the government announced the partition of Bengal in July 1905. Within days, protest meetings were held in small towns all over Bengal. It was in these meetings that the pledge to boycott foreign goods was first taken. On August 7, 1905, with the passage of the

The Moderate-Extremist dispute over the pace of the movement and techniques of struggle reached a deadlock at the Surat session of the Indian National Congress (1907) where the party split with serious consequences for the Swadeshi Movement.

 foundation of a national university in Bengal. A National Council of Education was set up on August 15, 1906, and the Bengal National College and Bengal Technical Institute were established. The first principal of the Bengal National College was Aurobindo Ghosh and its first president was Rashbehari Ghosh. 

The college was inspired by Tagore’s school at Shantiniketan which had been set up in 1901. Several more national schools were established in Bengal and Bihar. Satishchandra Mukherjee’s role in encouraging national education should not be ignored. His newspaper Dawn, in circulation since 1

897, and his Dawn Society, set up in 1902, had already been propagating the message of self-help in industry and education. Mukherjee pioneered the national education movement by founding the Bhagabat Chatuspathi in 1895. He took a leading p

 insurance companies, shops, etc. These enterprises were based more on patriotic zeal than on business acumen. Sakharam Ganesh Deuskar, a close associate of Aurobindo Ghosh, published Desher Katha in 1904. The work inspired the swadeshi activists. He popularised the ideas of Dadabhai Naoroji and Mahadev Govind Ranade and promoted swadeshi in a popular idiom. Desher Katha, writes Ishita Banerjee-Dube, 

warned against the colonial state’s “hypnotic conquest of the mind”. Before the book was banned by the colonial government in 1910, it had sold over 15,000 copies. It was the inspiration for many swadeshi street plays and folk songs, besides becoming mandatory reading for the swadeshi activists.

a national shipbuilding enterprise—Swadeshi Steam Navigation Company—at Tuticorin, however, gave a challenge to the British Indian Steam Navigation Company. There had been a consciousness even in the 1890s that Indian products should be encouraged in the face of the onslaught of the imported foreign goods. To this effect, members of the Tagore family and other leaders had been organising melas (fairs)

 to exhibit Indian handicrafts and putting up stores for their sale so that their production could be encouraged. Rabindranath’s Swadeshi Bhandar (1897), Jogeshchandra Chaudhuri’s Indian Stores (1901), and Sarala Debi’s Lakshmir Bhandar (1903) were all efforts in this direction. The Bengal Chemicals factory had been established by Prafullachandra Ray in 1893, and attempts were made to manufacture

 porcelain in 1901, as pointed out by Sumit Sarkar. Such efforts gained in momentum with the mood of the Swadeshi Movement. Impact in the Cultural Sphere The nationalists of all hues took inspiration from songs written

on from Ajanta, Mughal, and Rajput paintings. Nandalal Bose, who left a major imprint on Indian art, was the first recipient of a scholarship offered by the Indian Society of Oriental Art, founded in 1907. In science, Jagdish Chandra Bose, Prafullachandra Roy, and others pioneered original research which was praised the world over. Extent of Mass Participation Students Students came out in large numbe

Also, the nature of the Swadeshi Movement, with leaders evoking Hindu festivals and goddesses for

In September 1905, more than 250 Bengali clerks of the Burn Company, Howrah, walked out in protest against a derogatory work regulation. In July 1906, a strike of workers in the East Indian Railway resulted in the for

mation of a Railwaymen’s Union. Between 1906 and 1908, strikes in the jute mills were very frequent, at times affecting 18 out of 18 mills. Subramania Siva and Chidambaram Pillai led strikes in Tuticorin and Tirunelveli in a foreign-owned cotton mill. I

Annulment of Partition It was decided to annul the partition of Bengal in 1911, mainly to curb the menace of revolutionary terrorism. The annulment came as a rude shock to the Muslim political elite. It was also decided to shift the capital to Delhi as a sop to the Muslims, as 

with Muslim glory, but the Muslims were not pleased. Bihar and Orissa were taken out of Bengal, and Assam was made a separate province. Evaluation of the Swadeshi Movement The Movement Fizzles Out By 1908, the open phase (as different from the underground revolutionary phase) of the Swadeshi and Boycott movement was almost over. This was due to many reasons: ● There was severe government repression.  

ish jails, social reform, and constructive work—but failed to give these techniques a disciplined focus. ● The movement was rendered leaderless with most of the leaders either arrested or deported by 1908 and with Aurobindo Ghosh and Bipin Chandra Pal retiring from active politics. ● Internal squabbles among leaders, magnified by the Surat split (1907), did much harm to the movement. ● The movement ar

Between 1907 and 1911, five new laws were brought into force to check anti-government activity. These legislations included the Seditious Meetings Act, 1907; Indian Newspapers (Incitement to Offences) Act, 1908; 

Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1908; and the Indian Press Act, 1910. Tilak, the main Extremist leader, was tried in 1909 for sedition for what he had written in 1908 in his Kesari about a bomb thrown by Bengal revolutionaries in Muzaffarpur, resulting in the death of two innocent European women. Tilak had written: “This, no doubt, will inspire many with hatred ag

Morley-Minto Reforms of 1909 In October 1906, a group of Muslim elites called the Simla Deputation, led by the Agha Khan, met Lord Minto and demanded separate electorates for the Muslims and representation in excess of their num

king ‘to the defence of the empire’. The same group quickly took over the Muslim League, initially floated by Nawab Salimullah of Dacca along with Nawabs Mohsin-ul-Mulk and Waqar-ul- Mulk in December 1906. The Muslim League intended to preach loyalty to the empire and to keep the Muslim intelligentsia away from the Congress. Gopal Krishna Gokhale also went to England to meet the Secretary of State for

to placate the Moderates as well as the Muslims. They worked out a set of measures that came to be known as the Morley- Minto (or Minto-Morley) Reforms that translated into the Indian Councils Act of 1909. ● The elective principle was recognised for the nonofficial membership of the councils in India. Indians were allowed to participate in the election of various legislative councils, though on the ba

Evaluation The reforms of 1909 afforded no answer to the Indian political problem. Lord Morley made it clear that colonial self-government (as demanded by the Congress) was not suitable for India, 

 the councils by demanding universal primary education, attacking repressive policies, and drawing attention to the plight of indentured labour and Indian workers in South Africa. What the reforms of 1909 gave to the people of the country was a shadow rather than substance. The people had demanded self-government, but what they were given instead was ‘benevolent despotism’.

Bengal By the 1870s, Calcutta’s student community was honeycombed with secret societies, but these were not very active. The first revolutionary groups were organised in 1902 in Midnapore (under Jnanendranath Basu) and

 Mitter, and including Jatindranath Banerjee, Barindra Kumar Ghosh, and others.) But their activities were limited to giving physical and moral training to the members and remained insignificant till 1907–08.  

First Phase of Revolutionary Activities (1907–1917) ✫ 301

 In April 1906, an inner circle within Anushilan (Barindra Kumar Ghosh, Bhupendranath Dutta) started the weekly Yugantar and conducted a few abortive ‘actions’. By 1905– 06, several newspapers had started advocating revolutionary violence. For instance, after severe police brutalities on participants of the Barisal Conference (April 1906), the Yugantar wrote: “The r

n Sanyal had organised a secret society covering far-flung areas of Punjab, Delhi, and United Provinces, while some others like Hemachandra Kanungo went abroad for military and political training. In 1907, an abortive attempt was made by the Yugantar group on the life of a very unpopular British official, Sir Fuller (the first Lt. Governor of the new province of Eastern Bengal and Assam, although he h

In December 1907, there were attempts to derail the train on which the lieutenant-governor, Sri Andrew Fraser, was travelling In 1908, Prafulla Chaki and Khudiram Bose threw a bomb at a carriage supposed to be carrying a particularly sadistic white judge, Kingsford, in Muzaffarpur.

Jatin Mukherjee was shot and died a hero’s death in Balasore on the Orissa coast in September 1915. “We shall die to awaken the nation”, was the call of Bagha Jatin.

Maharashtra The first of the revolutionary activities in Maharashtra was the organisation of the Ramosi Peasant Force by Vasudev Balwant Phadke in 1879, which aimed to rid the country of the British by instigating an armed revolt by disrupting communication lines. It hoped to raise funds for its activities through dacoities. It was suppressed premat

urely. During the 1890s, Tilak propagated a spirit of militant nationalism, including the use of violence, through Ganapati and Shivaji festivals and his journals Kesari and Maharatta. Two of his disciples—the Chapekar bro

thers, Damodar and Balkrishna—murdered the Plague Commissioner of Poona, Rand, and one Lt. Ayerst in 1897. Savarkar and his brother organised Mitra Mela, a secret society, in 1899, which merged with Abhinav Bharat (after Mazzinni’s ‘Young Italy’) in 1904. Soon Nasik, Poona, and Bombay emerged as centres of bomb manufacture. In 1909, A.M.T. Jackson, the Collector of Nasik, who

Extremism in Punjab died down quickly after the government struck in May 1907 with a ban on political meetings and the deportation of Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh. After this, Ajit Singh and a few other associates—Sufi Ambaprasad, Lalchand, Bhai Parmanand, Lala Hardayal— develope

At the close of 1913, Bose met Jatin to discuss the possibilities of an all-India armed rising of 1857 type. Then, he worked in cooperation with Bagha Jatin, extending the Bengal plan to Punjab and the upper provinces. A

 Acts, and the quest for arms took Indian revolutionaries abroad. Shyamji Krishnavarma had started in London in 1905 an Indian Home Rule Society—‘India House’—as a centre for Indian students, a scholarship scheme to bring radical youth from India, and a journal The Indian Sociologist. Revolutionaries such as Savark

ar and Hardayal became the members of India House. Madanlal Dhingra from this circle assassinated the India office bureaucrat Curzon-Wyllie in 1909. Soon, London became too dangerous for the revolutionaries, particularly after Savarkar had been extradited in 1910 and transported for life in the Nasik conspiracy case. New centres emerged on the c

ontinent—Paris and Geneva—from where Madam Bhikaji Cama, a Parsi revolutionary who had developed contacts with French socialists and who brought out Bande Mataram, and Ajit Singh operated. And after 1909 when Anglo-German relations deteriorated, Virendranath Chattopadhyaya chose Berlin as his base.

evolutionaries were contacted; Rashbehari Bose and Sachin Sanyal were asked to lead the movement. Political dacoities were committed to raise funds. The Punjab political dacoities of January–February 1915 had a somewhat new social content. In at least 3 out of the 5 main cases, the raiders targeted the moneylenders and the debt records before decamping with the cash. Thus, an explosive situation was c

reated in Punjab. The Ghadrites fixed February 21, 1915 as the date for an armed revolt in Ferozepur, Lahore, and Rawalpindi garrisons. The plan was foiled at the last moment due to treachery. The authorities took immediate action, aided by the Defence of

 India Rules, 1915. Rebellious regiments were disbanded, leaders arrested and deported, and 45 of them hanged. Rashbehari Bose fled to Japan (from where he and Abani Mukherji made many efforts to send arms), while Sach

The British met the wartime threat with a formidable battery of repressive measures—the most intensive since 1857—and above all by the Defence of India Act passed in March 1915 primarily to smash the Ghadr movement. There were large-scale detentions without trial, special courts giving extremely severe sentences

 311 CHAPTER 14 First World War and Nationalist Response In the First World War (1914–19), Britain allied with France, Russia, USA, Italy, and Japan against Germany, Austria- Hungary, and Turkey. This period saw the maturing of Indian nationalism. The nationalist response to British p

articipation in the First World War was three-fold: (i) the Moderates supported the empire in the war as a matter of duty; (ii) the Extremists, including Tilak (who was released in June 1914), supported the war efforts in the mistaken belief that Britain would repay India’s loyalty with gratitude in the form of selfgovernment; and (iii) the revolutionaries decided to utilise the opportun

 (v) Tilak was ready to assume leadership after his release in June 1914, and had made conciliatory gestures— to the government reassuring it of his loyalty and to the Moderates that he wanted, like the Irish Home Rulers, a reform of the administration and not an overthro

ly served to retard the pace of political progress in India. He urged all Indians to assist the British government in its hour of crisis. (vi) Annie Besant, the Irish theosophist based in India since 1896, had decided to enlarge the sphere of her activities to include the building of a movement for home rule on the lines of the Irish Home Rule Leagues. The Leagues Both Tilak and Besant realised that t

he sanction of a Moderate-dominated Congress as well as full cooperation of the Extremists was essential for the movement to succeed. Having failed at the 1914 session of the Congress to reach a Moderate-Extremist rapprochement, Tilak and Besant decided to revive political activity on their own. By early 1915, Annie Besant had launched a campaign to demand 

ia after the war on the lines of white colonies. She campaigned through her newspapers, New India and Commonweal, and through public meetings and conferences. At the annual session of the Congress in 1915, the efforts of Tilak and Besant met with some success. It was decided that the Extremists be admitted to the Congress. Although Besant failed to get the Congress to approve her scheme of Home Rule L

 Tilak’s League Tilak set up his Indian Home Rule League in April 1916. Tilak held his first Home Rule meeting at Belgaum. Poona was the headquarters of his league. His league was restricted to Maharashtra (excluding Bombay city), Karnataka, Central Provinces, and Berar

 It had six branches and the demands included swarajya, formation of linguistic states and education in the vernacular. Besant’s League Annie Besant set up her All-India Home Rule League in September 1916 in Madras (now Chennai) and covered the rest of India (including Bombay city). It had 200 branches, was loosely organised as compared to Tilak’s league and had George Arundale as the organising secre

papers, pamphlets, posters, illustrated post-cards, plays, religious songs, etc., collecting funds, organising social work, and participating in local government activities. The Russian Revolution of 1917 proved to be an added advantage for the Home Rule campaign. The Home Rule agitation was later joined by Motilal Nehru, Jawaharlal Nehru, Bhulabhai Desai, Chittaranjan Das, K.M. Munshi, B. Chakravarti

udents were prohibited from attending political meetings. A case was instituted against Tilak which was, however, rescinded by the high court. Tilak was barred from entering Punjab and Delhi. In June 1917, Annie Besant and her associates, B.P. Wadia and George Arundale, were arrested. This invited nationwide protest. In a dramatic gesture, Sir S. Subramania Aiyar renounced his knighthood, while Tilak 

...cut his wife into fifty-two pieces only to discover that he had fifty-two wives. This is what happens to the Government of India when it interns Mrs Besant.” Annie Besant was released in September 1917. Why the Agitation Faded Out by 1919 The Home Rule agitation proved to be short-lived. By 1919, it had petered out. The reasons for the decline were as follows: (i) There was a lack of effective orga

nisation. (ii) Communal riots were witnessed during 1917–18. (iii) The Moderates who had joined the Congress after Annie Besant’s arrest were pacified by talk of reforms (contained in Montagu’s statement of August 1917 which held self-government as the lon

g-term goal of the British rule in India) and Besant’s release. (iv) Talk of passive resistance by the Extremists kept the Moderates away from activity from September 1918 onwards. (v) The Montagu-Chelmsford reforms, which became known in July 1918, further divided the nationalist ranks. Annie Besant herself was in two minds about the use of the league after the announ

 vacillated over her response to the reforms and the techniques of passive resistance. (vi) Tilak had to go abroad (September 1918) in connection with a libel case against Valentine Chirol whose book, Indian Unrest, had featured Tilak as responsible for the agitational politics that had developed in India. With Besant unable to 

 for freedom was slowly but surely catching the imagination of the people, and the mass movement that was gathering momentum pushed the home rule movement onto the side lines till it petered out.

Within a year, however, the league joined the Indian National Congress.] Po

when the national movement entered its mass phase in a true sense. (iii) It created a generation of ardent nationalists. (iv) It prepared the masses for politics of the Gandhian style. (v) The August 1917 declaration of Montagu and the Montford reforms were influenced by the Home Rule agitation. (vi) The efforts of Tilak and Annie Besant towards the  

 Moderate-Extremist reunion at Lucknow (1916) revived the Congress as an effective instrument of Indian nationalism. (vii) The home rule movement lent a new dimension and a sense of urgency to the national movement. Lucknow Session of the India

Montagu’s Statement of August 1917 The Secretary of State for India, Edwin Samuel Montagu, made a statement on August 20, 1917 in the British House of Commons in what has come to be known as the August Declaration of 1917. The stateme

 Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms and Government of India Act, 1919 The British government, not prepared to part with or even share its power with the Indians, once again resorted to the policy of ‘carrot and stick’. The carrot was represented by the insubstantial Mo

ntagu-Chelmsford Reforms, while measures such as the Rowlatt Act represented the stick. In line with the government policy contained in Montagu’s statement of August 1917, the government announced further constitutional reforms in July 1918, known as Montagu-Chelmsford or Montford Reforms. Based on these, the Government of India Act, 1919 was enacted. Main Features Th

t 75 per cent of the budget was still not votable. Some Indians found their way into important committees, including finance. ● On the home government (in Britain) front, the Government of India Act, 1919 made an important change— the Secretary of State for India was henceforth to be paid out of the British exchequer. Drawbacks The reforms had many drawbacks: (i) Franchise was very limited. The electo

Congress Reaction The Congress met in a special session in August 1918 at Bombay under Hasan Imam’s presidency and declared the reforms to be “disappointing” and “unsatisfactory” and demanded effective self-government instead. The Montford reforms were termed “unworthy 

er and India to accept”. Views When the Cabinet used the expression ‘ultimate self-government’ they probably contemplated an intervening period of 500 years. —Lord Curzon The Government of India Act, 1919 forged fresh fetters for the people. —Subhash Chandra Bose The Montford Reforms...were only a method of further draining India of her wealth and of prolonging her servitude. —M.K.

 Making of Gandhi Early Career and Experiments with Truth in South Africa Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869 in Porbandar in the princely state of Kathiawar in Gujarat. His father was a diwan (minister) of the state. Having studied law in England, Gandhi, in 1893, went to South Africa in connection with a c

ich Asians, who had gone to South Africa as labourers, were subjected. He decided to stay in South Africa to organise the Indian workers to enable them to fight for their rights. He stayed there till 1914, after which he returned to India. The Indians in South Africa consisted of three categories—one, the indentured Indian labour, mainly from South India, who had migrated to South Africa after 1890 to

escribed locations which were insanitary and congested. In some colonies, Asians and Africans could not stay out of doors after 9 p.m. nor could they use public footpaths. Moderate Phase of Struggle (1894–1906) During this phase, Gandhi relied on sending petitions and memorials to the authorities in South Africa and in Britain, hoping that once the authorities were informed of the plight of Indians, t

 Phase of Passive Resistance or Satyagraha (1906–1914) The second phase, which began in 1906, was characterised by the use of the method of passive resistance or civil disobedience, which Gandhi named satyagraha. Satyagraha against Registration Certificates (1906) A new legislation in South

The Tolstoy Farm was founded in 1910 and named as such by Gandhi’s associate, Herman Kallenbach, after the Russian writer and moralist, whom Gandhi admired and corresponded with. Besides being an experiment in education, it was to house

 the families of the satyagrahis and to give them a way to sustain themselves. The Tolstoy Farm was the second of its kind established by Gandhi. He had set up the Phoenix Farm in 1904 in Natal, inspired by a reading of John Ruskin’s Unto This Last, a critique of capitalism, and a work that extolled the virtues of the simple life of love, labour, and the dignity of human beings. As

 Gandhi’s objective in this context was to inculcate the ideals of social service and citizenship besides a healthy respect for manual work from the early formative years itself. The farm worked till 1913.  

ardly. Even violence was preferred to cowardice. Thought was never to be separated from practice. In other words, ends could not justify the means. Gandhi in India Gandhi returned to India in January 1915. His efforts in South Africa were well known not only among the educated but also among the masses. He decided to tour the country the next one year and see for himself the condition of the masses. H

ique capable of meeting the nationalist aims was a non-violent satyagraha. He also said that he would join no political organisation unless it too accepted the creed of non-violent satyagraha. During 1917 and 1918, Gandhi was involved in three struggles—in Champaran, Ahmedabad, and Kheda—before he launched the Rowlatt Satyagraha. Champaran Satyagraha (1917)—First Civil Disobedience Gandhi was requeste

ivil disobedience in India. Other popular leaders associated with Champaran Satyagraha were Brajkishore Prasad, Anugrah Narayan Sinha, Ramnavmi Prasad, and Shambhusharan Varma. Ahmedabad Mill Strike (1918)— First Hunger Strike In March 1918, Gandhi intervened in a dispute between cotton mill owners of Ahmedabad and the workers over the issue of discontinuation of the plague bonus. The mill owners want

n fighting for justice. Anusuya Sarabhai was a social worker who was also the sister of Ambalal Sarabhai, one of the mill owners and the president of the Ahmedabad Mill Owners Association (founded in 1891 to develop the textile industry in Ahmedabad), for help in fighting for justice. Anusuya Behn went to Gandhi, who was respected by the mill owners and workers, and asked him to intervene and help res

k up the workers’ cause. Anusuya too supported the workers and was one of the chief lieutenants of Gandhi’s. (It was Anusuya Behn who went on later to form the Ahmedabad Textile Labour Association in 1920.) Gandhi asked the workers to go on a strike and demand a 35 per cent increase in wages instead of 50 per cent. Gandhi advised the workers to remain non-violent while on strike. When negotiations wit

ing pressure on the mill owners who finally agreed to submit the issue to a tribunal. The strike was withdrawn. In the end, the tribunal awarded the workers a 35 per cent wage hike. Kheda Satyagraha (1918)—First Non-Cooperation Because of drought in 1918, the crops failed in Kheda district of Gujarat. According to the Revenue Code, if the yield was less than one-fourth the normal produce, the farmers 

 authorities of the province requesting that the revenue assessment for the year 1919 be suspended. The government, however, remained adamant and said that the property of the farmers would be seized if the taxes were not paid. Gandhi asked the farmers not to pay the taxes. Gandhi, ho

ontford Reforms were to be put into effect, two bills were introduced in the Imperial Legislative Council. One of them was dropped, but the other—an extension to the Defence of India Regulations Act, 1915—was passed in March 1919. It was what was officially called the Anarchical and Revolutionary Crimes Act, but popularly known as the Rowlatt Act. It was based on the recommendations made in the previo

 provisions of the wartime Defence of India Act (1915) by a permanent law. So, the wartime restrictions on freedom of speech and assembly were re-imposed in India. There was strict control over the press, and the government was armed with a variety of p

ion of the national movement turned to the masses permanently. Gandhi said that salvation would come when masses were awakened and became active in politics. Satyagraha was to be launched on April 6, 1919, but before it could be launched, there were large-scale violent, anti-British demonstrations in Calcutta, Bombay, Delhi, Ahmedabad, etc. Especially in Punjab, the situation became  

 so very explosive due to wartime repression, forcible recruitments, and ravages of disease that the Army had to be called in. April 1919 saw the biggest and the most violent anti-British upsurge since 1857. The Lieutenant Governor of Punjab, Sir Michael O’Dwyer, is said to have used aircraft strafing against the violent protestors. Ja

llianwala Bagh Massacre (April 13, 1919) Amritsar was the worst affected by violence. In the beginning, there was no violence by the protestors. Indians shut down their shops and normal trade, and the empty streets showed the Indians’ disp

 Gandhi gave up the title of Kaiser-i-Hind, bestowed by the British for his work during the Boer War. Gandhi was overwhelmed by the atmosphere of total violence and withdrew the movement on April 18, 1919. Seen in an objective way, Dyer ensured the beginning of the end of the British Raj. What had happened in Amritsar made Gandhi declare that cooperation with a ‘satanic regime’ was now impossible. He 

o the noncooperation movement was ready. According to the historian, A.P.J Taylor, the Jallianwala Bagh massacre was the “decisive moment when Indians were alienated from British rule”. The events of 1919 were to shape Punjab’s politics of resistance. Bhagat Singh was just 11 at the time of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. For Bhagat Singh’s Bharat Naujawan Sabha, the massacre was to act as a symbol tha

 Udham Singh, who bore the name, Ram Mohammad Singh Azad, later assassinated Michael O’Dwyer, the Lieutenant Governor who presided over the brutal British suppression of the 1919 protests in Punjab. Udham Singh was hanged in 1940 for his deed. (His ashes were returned to India in 1974.) The Hunter Committee of Inquiry The massacre at Jallianwalla Bagh shocked Indians and many

 British as well. The Secretary of State for India, Edwin Montagu, ordered that a committee of inquiry be formed to investigate the matter. So, on October 14, 1919, the Government of India announced the formation of the Disorders Inquiry Committee, which came to be more widely and variously known as the Hunter Committee/Commission after the name of its chairman

ort to tend to the wounded after the shooting as he did not consider it his job. Though Dyer’s statement caused racial tensions among the members of the committee, the final report, released in March 1920, unanimously condemned Dyer’s actions. The report stated that the lack of notice to disperse from the Bagh in the beginning was an error; the length of firing showed a grave error; Dyer’s motive of p

 continue in his post. The decision that Dyer should be dismissed was conveyed to the Army Council. In the end, Dyer was found guilty of a mistaken notion of duty and relieved of his command in March 1920. He was recalled to England. No legal action was taken against him; he drew half pay and received his army pension. Dyer was not, however, universally condemned. In the House of Lords, most of the pe

 345 CHAPTER 16 Non-Cooperation Movement and Khilafat Aandolan During 1919–22, the British were opposed through two mass movements—the Khilafat and Non-Cooperation. Though the two movements emerged from separate issues, they adopted a common programme of action—that of non-

ackground The background to the two movements was provided by a series of events after the First World War, which belied all hopes of the government’s generosity towards the Indian subjects. The year 1919, in particular, saw a strong feeling of discontent among all sections of Indians for various reasons: ● The economic situation of the country in the post- War years had become alarming, with a rise i

fy the rising demand of the Indians for self-government. The post-First World War period also saw the preparation of the ground for common political action by Hindus and Muslims—(i) the Lucknow Pact (1916) had stimulated Congress-Muslim League cooperation; (ii) the Rowlatt Act agitation brought Hindus and Muslims, and also other sections of the society, together; and (iii) radical nationalist Muslims 

 from the British (i) that the Khalifa’s control over Muslim sacred places should be retained, and (ii) the Khalifa should be left with sufficient territories after territorial arrangements. In early 1919, a Khilafat Committee was formed under the leadership of the Ali brothers (Shaukat Ali and Muhammad Ali), Maulana Azad, Ajmal Khan, and Hasrat Mohani, to force the British government to change its at

ilafat. Later, however, a militant trend emerged, demanding an active agitation such as stopping all cooperation with the British. Thus, at the All India Khilafat Conference held in Delhi in November 1919, a call was made for the boycott of British goods. The Khilafat leaders also clearly spelt out that unless peace terms after the War were favourable to Turkey they would stop all cooperation with the

content. Muslim League Support to Congress The Muslim League also decided to give full support to the Congress and its agitation on political questions. The Non-Cooperation Khilafat Movement February 1920 In early 1920, a joint Hindu-Muslim deputation was sent to the viceroy to seek redress of grievances on the issue of Khilafat, but the mission proved abortive. In February 1920, Gandhi announced that

stitutional advance had been overshadowed by the Khilafat question and that he would soon lead a movement of non-cooperation if the terms of the peace treaty failed to satisfy the Indian Muslims. May 1920 The Treaty of Sevres with Turkey, signed in May 1920, completely dismembered Turkey. June 1920 An all-party conference at Allahabad approved a programme of boycott of schools, colleges, and law court

 August 31, 1920 The Khilafat Committee started a campaign of non-cooperation, and the movement was formally launched. (Tilak had, incidentally, breathed his last on August 1, 1920.) September 1920 At a special session in Calcutta, the Congress approved a non-cooperation programme till the Punjab and Khilafat wrongs were removed and swaraj was established. The programme was to include: ● boycot

e were some differences over this as some leaders like C.R. Das were not willing to include a boycott of councils, but bowed to Congress discipline; these leaders boycotted elections held in November 1920, and the majority of the voters too stayed away); ● boycott of foreign cloth and use of khadi instead; also practice of hand-spinning to be done; ● renunciation of government honours and titles; the 

t service, and non-payment of taxes. During the movement, the participants were supposed to work for Hindu-Muslim unity and for removal of untouchability, all the time remaining non-violent. December 1920 At the Nagpur session of the Indian National Congress: (i) The programme of non-cooperation was endorsed. (ii) An important change was made in the Congress creed: now, instead of having the attainmen

and played a minor role in national politics henceforward. The adoption by the Congress of the non-cooperation movement initiated earlier by the Khilafat Committee gave it a new energy, and the years 1921 and 1922 saw an unprecedented popular upsurge. Spread of the Movement Gandhi accompanied by the Ali brothers undertook a nationwide tour. Thousands of students left government schools and colleges an

 Congress volunteer corps emerged as the parallel police. In July 1921, the Ali brothers gave a call to the Muslims to resign from the army as it was unreligious. The Ali brothers were arrested for this in September. Gandhi echoed their call and asked local Congress com

 Guntur (Andhra) was going on. In Assam, strikes in tea plantations, steamer services, and Assam-Bengal Railways had been organised. J.M. Sengupta was a prominent leader in these strikes. In November 1921, the visit of the Prince of Wales to India invited strikes and demonstrations. The spirit of defiance and unrest gave rise to many local struggles such as Awadh Kisan Movement (UP), Eka Movement (UP)

 Government Response Talks between Gandhi and Reading, the viceroy, broke down in May 1921 as the government wanted Gandhi to urge the Ali brothers to remove those portions from speeches which suggested violence. Gandhi realised that the government was trying to drive a wedge between him a

rring Gandhi were arrested. The Last Phase of the Movement Gandhi was now under increasing pressure from the Congress rank and file to start the civil disobedience programme. The Ahmedabad session in 1921 (presided over, incidentally, by C.R. Das while still in jail; Hakim Ajmal Khan was the acting president) appointed Gandhi the sole authority on the issue. On February 1, 1922, Gandhi threatened to l

abrupt end. Chauri Chaura Incident A small sleepy village named Chauri-Chaura (Gorakhpur district in United Provinces) has found a place in history books due to an incident of violence on February 5, 1922, which was to prompt Gandhi to withdraw the movement. The police here had beaten up the leader of a group of volunteers campaigning against liquor sale and high food prices, and then opened fire on t

in the violence. Gandhi, not happy with the increasingly violent trend of the movement, immediately announced the withdrawal of the movement. The Congress Working Committee met at Bardoli in February 1922 and resolved to stop all activity that led to  

s of the Mahatma, Deshbandhu Das, Pandit Motilal Nehru and Lala Lajpat Rai, who were all in prison, shared the popular resentment. —Subhas Chandra Bose A mass wave of revolutionary unrest in India in 1919 (evident from the labour unrest and strike wave of 1919-20 and peasant protests in UP and Bihar) ..... worked as a kind of popular groundswell virtually forcing the leadership to a radical posture...

 —Marxist Interpretation I would suffer every humiliation, every torture, absolute ostracism and death itself to prevent the movement from becoming violent. —M.K. Gandhi, in Young India, February 16, 1922 breaking of the law and to get down to constructive work, instead, which was to include popularisation of khadi, national schools, and campaigning for temperance, for Hindu-Muslim unity and against u

ility. Most of the nationalist leaders including C.R. Das, Motilal Nehru, Subhash Bose, Jawaharlal Nehru, however, expressed their bewilderment at Gandhi’s decision to withdraw the movement. In March 1922, Gandhi was arrested and sentenced to six years in jail. He made the occasion memorable by a magnificent court speech: “I am here, therefore, to invite and submit cheerfully to the highest penalty th

sustain any movement at a high pitch for very long. The government seemed to be in no mood for negotiations. The central theme of the agitation—the Khilafat question—also dissipated soon. In November 1922, the people of Turkey rose under Mustafa Kamal Pasha and deprived the sultan of political power. Turkey was made a secular state. Thus, the Khilafat question lost its relevance. A European style of l

egal system was established in Turkey and extensive rights granted to women. Education was nationalised and modern agriculture and industries developed. In 1924, the caliphate was abolished. Evaluation of Khilafat Non-Cooperation Movement The movement brought the urban Muslims into the national movement, but at the same time it communalised the national poli

CHAPTER 17 Emergence of Swarajists, Socialist Ideas, Revolutionary Activities, and Other New Forces Swarajists and No-Changers Genesis of Congress-Khilafat Swarajya Party After Gandhi’s arrest (March 1922), there was disintegration, disorganisation, and demoralisation among nationalist ranks. A debate started among Congressmen on what to do during the transition period, i.e., the passive phase of the 

r the question of council entry between the two schools of thought resulted in the defeat of the Swarajists’ proposal of ‘ending or mending’ the councils at the Gaya session of the Congress (December 1922). C.R. Das and Motilal Nehru resigned from the presidentship and secretaryship respectively of the Congress and announced the formation of Congress-Khilafat Swarajya Party or simply Swarajist Party, 

k, loss of revolutionary zeal, and to political corruption. Constructive work would prepare everyone for the next phase of civil disobedience. Agree to Disagree Both sides, however, wanted to avoid a 1907-type split and kept in touch with Gandhi who was in jail. Both sides also realised the significance of putting up a united front to get  

troduce reforms, and both sides accepted the necessity of Gandhi’s leadership of a united nationalist front. Keeping these factors in mind, a compromise was reached at a meeting in Delhi in September 1923. The Swarajists were allowed to contest elections as a group within the Congress. The Swarajists accepted the Congress programme with only one difference—that they would join legislative councils. Th

e elections to the newly constituted Central Legislative Assembly and to provincial assemblies were to be held in November 1923. The Swarajist Manifesto for Elections Released in October 1923, the Swarajist manifesto took a strong anti-imperialist line. The points put forward were as follows: ● The guiding motive of the British in governing India lay in selfish interests of their own coun

thin by creating deadlocks on every measure. Gandhi’s Attitude Gandhi was initially opposed to the Swarajist proposal of council entry. But after his release from prison on health grounds in February 1924, he gradually moved towards a reconciliation with the Swarajists. ● He felt public opposition to the programme of council entry would be counterproductive. ● In the November 1923 elections, the Swara

 functioned convinced him that they would not become just another limb of colonial administration. ● There was a government crackdown on revolutionary terrorists and the Swarajists towards the end of 1924; this angered Gandhi and he expressed his solidarity with the Swarajists by surrendering to their wishes. Both sides came to an agreement in 1924 (endorsed at the Belgaum session of the Congress in D

ecember 1924 over which Gandhi—the only time—presided over the Congress session) that the Swarajists would work in the councils as an integral part of the Congress. Swarajist Activity in Councils Gradually, the S

 many Muslims when the party did not support the tenants’ cause against the zamindars in Bengal (most of the tenants were Muslims). Communal interests also entered the party. The death of C.R. Das in 1925 weakened it further. The Responsivists among Swarajists—Lala Lajpat Rai, Madan Mohan Malaviya, and N.C. Kelkar—advocated cooperation with the government and holding of office wherever possible. Besid

ndu even as Muslim communalists called the Swarajists anti-Muslim. Thus, the main leadership of the Swarajist Party reiterated faith in mass civil disobedience and withdrew from legislatures in March 1926, while another section of Swarajists went into the 1926 elections as a party in disarray and did not fare well on the whole. They won 40 seats in the Centre and some  

 seats in Madras but were routed in the United Provinces, the Central Provinces and Punjab. In 1930, the Swarajists finally walked out as a result of the Lahore Congress resolution on purna swaraj and the beginning of the Civil Disobedience Movement. Achievements (i) With coalition partners, they o

ournment motions. (ii) They agitated through powerful speeches on selfgovernment, civil liberties, and industrialisation. (iii) Vithalbhai Patel was elected speaker of Central Legislative Assembly in 1925. (iv) A noteworthy achievement was the defeat of the Public Safety Bill in 1928, which was aimed at empowering the Government to deport undesirable and subversive foreigners (because the Government w

ey embodied a positive or negative reaction to it. The international influence on Indian political thinkers during this phase was also more pronounced than before. The new forces to emerge during the 1920s included the following ideas and movements. Spread of Marxist and Socialist Ideas Ideas of Marx and Socialist thinkers inspired many groups to come into existence as socialists and communists. These

 nationalism and antiimperialism with social justice and simultaneously raised the question of internal class oppression by capitalists and landlords. The Communist Party of India (CPI) was formed in 1920 in Tashkent (now, the capital of Uzbekistan) by M.N. Roy, Abani Mukherji, and others after the second Congress of Commintern. M.N. Roy was also the first to be elected to the leadership of Commintern

. In 1924, many communists—S.A. Dange, Muzaffar Ahmed, Shaukat Usmani, Nalini Gupta—were jailed in the Kanpur Bolshevik Conspiracy Case.  

 In 1925, the Indian Communist Conference at Kanpur formalised the foundation of the CPI. In 1929, the government crackdown on communists resulted in the arrest and trial of 31 leading communists, trade unionists, and left-wing leaders; they were tried at Meerut in the famous Meerut conspiracy ca

an integral part of the national movement and worked along with the Congress. Activism of Indian Youth All over, students’ leagues were being established and students’ conferences were being held. In 1928, Jawaharlal Nehru presided over the All Bengal Students’ Conference. Peasants’ Agitations In the United Provinces peasant agitations were for revision of tenancy laws, lower rents, protection against

debtedness. Similar peasant agitations took place in the Rampa region of Andhra, in Rajasthan, in ryotwari areas of Bombay and Madras. In Gujarat, the Bardoli Satyagraha was led by Vallabhbhai Patel (1928). Growth of Trade Unionism The trade union movement was led by All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) founded in 1920. Lala Lajpat Rai was its first president and Dewan Chaman Lal its general secreta

ry. Tilak was also one of the moving spirits. The major strikes during the 1920s included those in Kharagpur Railway Workshops,Tata Iron and Steel Works (Jamshedpur), Bombay Textile Mills (this involved 1,50,000 workers and went on for 5 months), and Buckingham Carnatic Mills. I

n 1928, there were a number of strikes involving 5 lakh workers. In 1923, the first May Day was celebrated in India in Madras. Caste Movements As in earlier periods, the varied contradictions of the Indian society found expression in caste associations and movements. Thes

(ii) Russian Revolution (1917) and the success of the young Soviet state in consolidating itself. (iii) Newly sprouting communist groups with their emphasis on Marxism, socialism, and the proletariat. (iv) Journals publishing mem

olutionary activity in this region was dominated by the Hindustan Republican Association/Army or HRA (later renamed Hindustan Socialist Republican Association or HSRA). The HRA was founded in October 1924 in Kanpur by Ramprasad Bismil, Jogesh Chandra Chatterjee, and Sachin Sanyal, with an aim to organise an armed revolution to overthrow the colonial government and establish in its place the Federal Re

public of United States of India whose basic principle would be adult franchise. Kakori Robbery (August 1925) The most important action of the HRA was the Kakori robbery. The men held up the 8-Down train at Kakori, an  

akori setback, the younger revolutionaries, inspired by socialist ideas, set out to reorganise Hindustan Republic Association at a historic meeting in the ruins of Ferozshah Kotla in Delhi (September 1928). Under the leadership of Chandrashekhar Azad, the name of HRA was changed to Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA). The participants included Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev Thapar (who was always

ar Sinha, Shiv Verma, and Jaidev Kapur from the United Provinces. The HSRA decided to work under a collective leadership and adopted socialism as its official goal. Saunders’ Murder (Lahore, December 1928) Just when the HSRA revolutionaries had begun to move away from individual heroic action, the death of Sher-i-Punjab Lala Lajpat Rai due to lathi blows received during a lathi charge on an anti-Simon

 Commission procession (October 1928) led them once again to take to individual assassination. Bhagat Singh and Shivram Rajguru shot dead John P. Saunders. They had mistaken Saunders for Superintendent of Police James Scott, who was act

of India to efface it... We regret to have had to kill a person but he was part and parcel of that inhuman and unjust order which has to be destroyed.” Bomb in the Central Legislative Assembly (April 1929) The HSRA leadership now decided to let the people know about its changed objectives and the need for a revolution  

 by the masses. Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt were asked to throw a bomb in the Central Legislative Assembly on April 8, 1929 to protest against the passage of the Public Safety Bill and Trade Disputes Bill aimed at curtailing civil liberties of citizens in general and workers in particular. The bombs had been deliberately 

 The defence of these young revolutionaries was organised by Congress leaders. Bhagat Singh became a household name. Azad was involved in a bid to blow up Viceroy Irwin’s train near Delhi in December 1929. During 1930, there were a series of violent actions in Punjab and towns of United Provinces (26 incidents in 1930 in Punjab alone). Chandrasekhar Azad arranged a meeting with fellow revolutionaries 

on February 27, 1931 at the Alfred Park (now Chandrashekhar Azad Park) in Allahabad. Betrayed by one of his associates, he and other revolutionaries were besieged by the British police. Azad put up a brave resistance but

d, thus, fulfilled his pledge of not being captured alive by the British. (The Colt pistol used by him is displayed at the Allahabad Museum. Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru were hanged on March 23, 1931 for the assassination of Saunders. (March 23 is now observed as Shaheed Diwas and Sarvodaya Day.) It is said that the three young men proceeded quite cheerfully  

 towards the gallows all the while chanting their favourite slogans like ‘Inquilab Zindabad’ and ‘Down with British Imperialism’. In Bengal During the 1920s many revolutionary groups reorganised their underground activities, while many continued working under the Congress, thus getting access to the masses and providing an organisational base to the Con

gress in towns and villages. Many cooperated with C.R. Das in his Swarajist work. After Das’s death (1925), the Bengal Congress broke up into two factions—one led by J.M. Sengupta (Anushilan group joined forces with him) and the other led by Subhash Bose (Yugantar group backed him). The actions of the re

organised groups included an assassination attempt on the notorious Calcutta Police Commissioner, Charles Tegart (another man named Day got killed) by Gopinath Saha in 1924. The government, armed with a new ordinance, came down heavily on revolutionaries. Many, including Subhash Bose, were arrested. Gopinath Saha was hanged. Because of government repression and factiona

ered a setback, but soon many of revolutionaries started regrouping. Among the new ‘Revolt Groups’, the most active and famous was the Chittagong group under Surya Sen. Chittagong Armoury Raid (April 1930) Surya Sen had participated in the Non-Cooperation Movement and had become a teacher in the national school in Chittagong. He was imprisoned from 1926 to 1928 for revolutionary activity and afterward

agong to seize and supply arms to the revolutionaries to destroy telephone and telegraph lines and to dislocate the railway link of Chittagong with the rest of Bengal. The raid was conducted in April 1930 and involved 65 activists under the banner of Indian Republican Army—Chittagong Branch. The raid was quite successful; Sen hoisted the national flag, took salute, and proclaimed a provisional revolut

ionary government. Later, they dispersed into neighbouring villages and raided government targets. Surya Sen was arrested in February 1933 and hanged in January 1934, but the Chittagong raid fired the imagination of the revolutionary-minded youth and recruits poured into the revolutionary groups in a steady stream. Aspects of the New Phase of Revolutionary Moveme

id; Kalpana Dutt who was arrested and tried along with Surya Sen and given a life sentence; Santi Ghosh and Suniti Chandheri, school girls of Comilla, who shot dead the district magistrate. (December 1931); and Bina Das who fired point blank at the governor while receiving her degree at the convocation (February 1932). ● There was an emphasis on group action aimed at organs of the colonial State, inst

rnment repression. Armed with 20 repressive acts, the government let loose the police on the revolutionaries. In Chittagong, several villages were burned and punitive fines imposed on many others. In 1933, Jawaharlal Nehru was arrested for sedition and given two years’ sentence because he had condemned imperialism and praised the heroism of the revolutionaries. Ideological Rethinking A real breakthrou

gh was made by Bhagat Singh and his comrades in terms of revolutionary ideology, forms of revolutionary struggle, and the goals of revolution. The rethinking had begun in the mid-1920s. The Founding Council of HRA had decided to preach revolutionary and communist principles, and the HRA Manifesto (1925) declared that the “HRA stood for abolition of all systems which made exploitat

 of heavy industries such as ship building and steel. The HRA had also decided to start labour and peasant organisations and work for an “organised and armed revolution”. During their last days (late 1920s), these revolutionaries had started moving away from individual heroic action and violence towards mass politics. Bismil, during his last days, appealed to the youth to give up pistols and revolvers

ment alone could lead to a successful revolution. In other words, revolution could only be “by the masses, for the masses”. That is why Bhagat Singh helped establish the Punjab Naujawan Bharat Sabha (1926) as an open wing of revolutionaries to carry out political work among the youth, peasants, and workers, and it was to open branches in villages. Bhagat and Sukhdev also organised the Lahore Students’

cil entry after withdrawal of Non- Cooperation Movement with an aim to end or mend the councils. No-Changers advocated constructive work during the transition period. ● Emergence of New Forces during 1920s 1. Spread of Marxism and socialist ideas 2. Activism of Indian youth 3.

 375 CHAPTER 18 Simon Commission and the Nehru Report Appointment of the Indian Statutory Commission The Government of India Act, 1919 had a provision that a commission would be appointed 10 years from date to study the progress of the governance scheme and suggest new steps. An all-white, seven-member Indian Statutory Commission, p

opularly known as the Simon Commission (after the name of its chairman, Sir John Simon), was set up by the British government under Stanley Baldwin’s prime ministership on November 8, 1927. The members were formed from four Conservatives, two Labourites, and one Liberal. (The commission was actually under the joint chairmanship of Sir John Simon and Clement Attlee, who was to be Britai

he future.) The commission was to recommend to the British government whether India was ready for further constitutional reforms and along what lines. Although constitutional reforms were due only in 1929, the Conservative government, then in power in Britain, feared defeat by the Labour Party and thus did not want to leave the question of the future of Britain’s most priced colony in “irresponsible L

abour hands”. Also by the mid-1920s, the failure of the 1919 Act to create a stable imperial power  

 had led to several parliamentary reports and enquiries. The Lee Commission was appointed in 1923 to look into the organisation and general conditions of service as well as the methods of recruitment for Europeans and Indians in the civil services. Being concerned only with the superior civil ser

 came to be known as the Royal Commission on the Superior Civil Services in India. The commission suggested that the statutory public service commission, as put forward by the Government of India Act 1919, needed to be established without delay. The Muddiman Committee, officially known as the Report of the Reforms Enquiry Committee, was set up in 1924, mainly to look into the working of the Constituti

on as set up in 1921 under the Act of 1919. Its report was not unanimous: while the majority suggested some minor changes in the structure of the Constitution, the minority, consisting of non-official Indians, strongly criticised the system o

f dyarchy and wanted it to be abolished immediately and the Constitution made democratic. In 1926, the Linlithgow Commission, officially the Royal Commission of Agriculture was set up to examine and report the condition of India’s agricultural and rural economy. The commission submitted its repor

t in 1928 and made comprehensive recommendations for the improvement of the agrarian economy as the foundation for the welfare and prosperity of India’s rural population. Among other things, the commission rec

 was seen as a violation of the principle of self-determination, and as a deliberate insult to the self-respect of Indians. Congress Response The Congress session in Madras (December 1927) meeting under the presidency of M.A. Ansari decided to boycott the commission “at every stage and in every form”. Meanwhile, Nehru succeeded in getting a snap resolution passed at the session, decla

ort the Congress call of boycott of the Simon Commission included the liberals of the Hindu Mahasabha and the majority faction of the Muslim League under Jinnah. The Muslim league had two sessions in 1927— one under Jinnah at Calcutta where it was decided to oppose the Simon Commission, and another at Lahore under Muhammad Shafi, who supported the government. Some others, such as the Unionists in Punj

ab and the Justice Party in the south, decided not to boycott the commission. Public Response The commission landed in Bombay on February 3, 1928. On that day, a countrywide hartal was organised and mass rallies held. Wherever the commission went, there were black flag demonstrations, hartals, and slogans of ‘Simon Go Back’. (As to who coined 

icharges not sparing even the senior leaders. Jawaharlal Dr Ambedkar and the Simon Commission Dr Ambedkar was appointed by the Bombay Legislative Council to work with the Simon Commission. In October 1928, Ambedkar went before the commission. He argued for ‘universal adult franchise’ for both male and female alike; for provincial autonomy in the provinces and dyrarchy at Centre.

Nehru Report As an answer to Lord Birkenhead’s challenge, an All Parties Conference met in February 1928 and appointed a subcommittee under the chairmanship of Motilal Nehru to draft a constitution. This was the first major attempt by the Indians to draft a constitutional framework for the country. The 

committee included Tej Bahadur Sapru, Subhas Chandra Bose, M.S. Aney, Mangal Singh, Ali Imam, Shuaib Qureshi, and G.R. Pradhan as its members. The report was finalised by August 1928. The recommendations of the Nehru Committee were unanimous except in one respect—while the majority favoured the “dominion status” as the basis of the Constitution, a section of it wanted “complete i

Delhi Proposals of Muslim League Earlier, in December 1927, a large number of Muslim leaders had met at Delhi at the Muslim League session and evolved four proposals for their demands to be incorporated into the draft constitution. These proposals, which wer

e accepted by the Madras session of the Congress (December 1927), came to be known as the ‘Delhi Proposals’. These were: ● joint electorates in place of separate electorates with reserved seats for Muslims; ● one-third representation to Muslims in Central Legisla

 minority in Sindh; ● Political structure proposed broadly unitary, as residual powers rested with the centre. Amendments Proposed by Jinnah At the All Parties Conference held at Calcutta in December 1928 to consider the Nehru Report, Jinnah, on behalf of the Muslim League, proposed three amendments to the report: (i) one-third representation to Muslims in the central legislature; (ii) reservation to 

suffrage was established; and (iii) residual powers to provinces. These demands were not accommodated. Jinnah’s Fourteen Points Jinnah went back to the Shafi faction of the Muslim League and in March 1929 gave 14 points which were to become the basis of all future propaganda of the Muslim League. The 14 points were as follows. 1. Federal Constitution with residual powers to provinces. 2. Provincial au

85 CHAPTER 19 Civil Disobedience Movement and Round Table Conferences The Run-up to Civil Disobedience Movement Calcutta Session of Congress It was at the Calcutta session of the Congress in December 1928 that the Nehru Report was approved but the younger elements led by Jawaharlal Nehru, Subhas Chandra Bose and Satyamurthy expressed their dissatisfaction with dominion status as the goal of Congress. 

 Political Activity during 1929 Gandhi travelled incessantly during 1929, preparing people for direct political action—telling the youth to prepare for the fiery ordeal, helping to organise constructive work in villages, and redressing specific grievances (on lines of the

 Bardoli agitation of 1928). The Congress Working Committee (CWC) organised a Foreign Cloth Boycott Committee to propagate an aggressive programme of boycotting foreign cloth and public burning of foreign cloth. Gandhi initiat

ed the campaign in March 1929 in Calcutta and was arrested. This was followed by bonfires of foreign cloth all over the country. Other developments which kept the political temperature high during 1929 included the Meerut Conspiracy Case (March), bomb explosion in Central Legislative Assembly by Bhagat Singh and B.K. Dutt (April), and the coming to power of the minority Labour government led by Ram

say MacDonald in England in May. And Wedgewood Benn became the Secretary of State for India. Irwin’s Declaration (October 31, 1929) Before the Simon Commission report came out, the declaration by Lord Irwin was made. It was the combined effort of the Labour government (always more sympathetic to Indian aspirations than the Conse

he purpose behind the declaration was to “restore faith in the ultimate purpose of British policy”. The declaration was made in the form of an official communique in the Indian Gazette on October 31, 1929. It said: “In view of the doubts which have been expressed both in Great Britain and in India regarding the interpretations to be placed on the intentions of the British government in enacting the st

atute of 1919, I am authorised on behalf of His Majesty’s Government to state clearly that in their judgement it is implicit in the Declaration of 1917 that the natural issue of India’s constitutional progress as they contemplated is the attainment of Dominion status.” However, there was no time scale. The dominion status promised by Irwin would not

 Lord Irwin also promised a Round Table Conference after the Simon Commission submitted its report. Delhi Manifesto On November 2, 1929, a conference of prominent national leaders issued a ‘Delhi Manifesto’, which put forward certain conditions for attending the Round Table Conference: 1. that the purpose of the Round Table Conferenc

t the conference; and 3. there should be a general amnesty for political prisoners and a policy of conciliation; Gandhi along with Motilal Nehru and other political leaders met Lord Irwin in December 1929 (after the viceroy had narrowly escaped after a bomb was detonated meaning to hit the train he was travelling in). They asked the viceroy for assurance that the purpose of the round table conference 

 Congress and Purna Swaraj Jawaharlal Nehru, who had done more than anyone else to popularise the concept of purna swaraj, was nominated the president for the Lahore session of the Congress (December 1929) mainly due to Gandhi’s backing (15 out of 18 Provincial Congress Committees had opposed Nehru). Nehru was chosen — because of the appositeness of the occasion (Congress’ acceptance of complete indep

 Congress Working Committee was authorised to launch a programme of civil disobedience, including non-payment of taxes, and all members of legislatures were asked to resign their seats. ● January 26, 1930 was fixed as the first Independence (Swarajya) Day, to be celebrated everywhere. December 31, 1929 At midnight on the banks of River Ravi, the newly adopted tricolour flag of freedom was hoisted by J

awaharlal Nehru amidst slogans of Inquilab Zindabad. January 26, 1930: the Independence Pledge Public meetings were organised all over the country in villages and towns and the independence pledge was read out in local languages and the national flag was hoisted. This 

alt Satyagraha and Other Upsurges Gandhi’s Eleven Demands To carry forward the mandate given by the Lahore Congress, Gandhi presented 11 demands to the government and gave an ultimatum of January 31, 1930 to accept or reject these demands. The demands were as follows: Issues of General Interest 1. Reduce expenditure on army and civil services by 50 per cent. 2. Introduce total prohibition.  

ncome, like khadi, for the poor through self-help. Like khadi, again, it offered to the urban populace the opportunity of a symbolic identification with mass suffering. Dandi March (March 12–April 6, 1930) On March 2, 1930, Gandhi informed the viceroy of his plan of action. According to this plan (few realised its significance when it was first announced), Gandhi, along with a band of 78 members of Sa

sroot-level organisational tasks. Spread of Salt Law Disobedience Once the way was cleared by Gandhi’s ritual at Dandi, defiance of the salt laws started all over the country. Nehru’s arrest in April 1930 for defiance of the salt law evoked huge demonstrations in Madras, Calcutta, and Karachi. Gandhi’s arrest came on May 4, 1930 when he had announced that he would lead a raid on Dharasana Salt Works o

 laws in the Central Provinces. Satyagraha at Different Places A brief survey of the nature of Civil Disobedience Movement in different parts of the subcontinent is given below. ● Tamil Nadu In April 1930, C. Rajagopalachari organised a march from Thiruchirapalli (Trichinapoly as it was called by the British) to Vedaranniyam on the Tanjore (or Thanjavur) coast to break the salt law. The event was foll

, organised salt marches. P. Krishna Pillai, the future founder of the Kerala Communist movement, heroically defended the national flag in the face of police lathi-charge on Calicut beach in November 1930. ● Andhra Region District salt marches were organised in east and west Godavari, Krishna, and Guntur. A number of sibirams (military style camps) were set up to serve as the headquarters of the Salt 

Satyagraha. The merchants contributed to Congress funds, and the dominant caste Kamma and Raju cultivators defied repressive measures. But the mass support like that in the non-cooperation movement (1921–22) was missing in the region. ● Orissa Under Gopalbandhu Choudhuri, a Gandhian leader, salt satyagraha proved effective in the coastal regions of Balasore, Cuttack, and Puri districts.  

 ● Assam The civil disobedience failed to regain the heights attained in 1921–22 due to divisive issues: the growing conflicts between Assamese and Bengalis, Hindus and Muslims, and the tensions developing from the inflow of Muslim peasants from the densely populated east Beng

al. However, a successful student strike against the Cunningham Circular, which banned students’ participation in politics, was seen in May 1930. Chandraprabha Saikiani, in December 1930, incited the aboriginal Kachari villages to break forest laws, which was, however, denied by the Assam Congress leadership. ● Bengal The Bengal Congress, divided into two factions led by Subhas Chand

and break the salt law under Ambika Kant Sinha. However, very soon, a very powerful nochaukidari tax agitation replaced the salt satyagraha (owing to physical constraints in making salt). By November 1930, sale of foreign cloth and liquor dramatically declined, and administration collapsed in several parts like the Barhee region of Munger. The tribal belt of Chhotanagpur (now in Jharkhand), saw instan

hto political monthly Pukhtoon and had organised a volunteer brigade ‘Khudai Khidmatgars’, popularly known as the ‘Red-Shirts’, who were pledged to the freedom struggle and non-violence. On April 23, 1930, the arrest of Congress leaders in the NWFP led to mass demonstrations in Peshawar, which was virtually in the hands of the crowds for more than a week till order was restored on May 4. This was foll

tions, police stations, municipal buildings, law courts, etc. The activists established a virtual parallel government which could only be dislodged with martial law after May 16. Dharasana On May 21, 1930, Sarojini Naidu, Imam Sahib, and Manilal (Gandhi’s son) took up the unfinished task of leading a raid on the Dharasana Salt Works. The unarmed and peaceful crowd was met with a brutal lathi-charge wh

a no-rent campaign, a call was given to tenants against zamindars. Since most of the zamindars were loyalists, the campaign became virtually a norent campaign. The activity picked up speed in October 1930, especially in Agra and Rai Bareilly. Manipur and Nagaland These areas took a brave part in the movement. At the young age of 13, Rani Gaidinliu, a Naga spiritual leader, who followed her cousin Haip

 rest of India. As the reformist religious movement steadily turned political, the British authorities caught Haipou Jadonang and hanged him on charges of treason in 1931. A manhunt was launched for Rani Gaidinliu. She outwitted the British till October 1932 when she was finally captured. She was later sentenced to life imprisonment. [It was the Interim Government of 

India set up in 1946 that finally ordered her release from Tura jail.] Forms of Mobilisation Mobilisation of masses was also carried out through prabhat pheries, vanar senas, manjari senas, secret patrikas, and magic lan

 into the public sphere. Students Along with women, students and youth played the most prominent part in the boycott of foreign cloth and liquor. Muslims The Muslim participation was nowhere near the 1920–22 level because of appeals by Muslim leaders to stay away from the movement and because of active government encouragement to communal dissension. Still, some areas such as the NWFP saw an overwhelm

s participated in Bombay, Calcutta, Madras, Sholapur, etc. Peasants were active in the United Provinces, Bihar, and Gujarat. Government Response—Efforts for Truce The government’s attitude throughout 1930 was ambivalent as it was puzzled and perplexed. It faced the classic dilemma of ‘damned if you do, damned if you don’t’, if force was applied, the Congress cried ‘repression’, and if little action ta

 and publication of the Simon Commission Report, which contained no mention of dominion status and was in other ways also a regressive document, further upset even moderate political opinion. In July 1930, the viceroy, Lord Irwin, suggested a round table conference and reiterated the goal of dominion status. He also accepted the suggestion that Tej Bahadur Sapru and M.R. Jayakar be allowed to explore 

the possibility of peace between the Congress and the government. In August 1930, Motilal and Jawaharlal Nehru were taken to Yerawada Jail to meet Gandhi and discuss the  

mplete national government with control over defence and finance; and 3. an independent tribunal to settle Britain’s financial claims. Talks broke down at this point. Gandhi-Irwin Pact On January 25, 1931, Gandhi and all other members of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) were released unconditionally. The CWC authorised Gandhi to initiate discussions with the viceroy. As a result of these discussio

ns, a pact was signed between the viceroy, representing the British Indian Government, and Gandhi, representing the Indian people, in Delhi on March 5, 1931. This Delhi Pact, also known as the Gandhi-Irwin Pact, placed the Congress on an equal footing with the government. Irwin on behalf of the government agreed on: 1. immediate release of all political 

use: (i) mass movements are necessarily short-lived; (ii) capacity of the masses to make sacrifices, unlike that of the activists, is limited; and (iii) there were signs of exhaustion after September 1930, especially among shopkeepers and merchants, who had participated so enthusiastically. No doubt, youth were disappointed: they had participated enthusiastically and wanted the world to end with a ban

iness groups compensated for decline of other features. 7. The number of those imprisoned was about three times more this time. 8. The Congress was organisationally stronger. Karachi Congress Session—1931 In March 1931, a special session of the Congress was held at Karachi to endorse the Gandhi-Irwin Pact. Six days before the session (which was held on March 29) Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, and Rajguru were

erence should be held, as the recommendations of the Simon Commission report were clearly inadequate. First Round Table Conference The first Round Table Conference was held in London between November 1930 and January 1931. It was opened officially by King George V on November 12, 1930 and chaired by Ramsay MacDonald.  

 to talk with the Viceroy. Gandhi and Irwin reached a compromise which came to be called the Gandhi-Irwin Pact (the Delhi Pact). The second Round Table Conference was held in London from September 7, 1931 to December 1, 1931. The Indian National Congress nominated Gandhi as its sole representative. A. Rangaswami Iyengar and Madan Mohan Malaviya were also there. There were a large number of Indian part

and (iv) the prospect of a unilateral British Communal Award if Indians failed to agree. The government refused to concede the basic Indian demand of freedom. Gandhi returned to India on December 28, 1931. Third Round Table Conference The third Round Table Conference, held between November 17, 1932 and December 24, 1932, was not attended by the Indian National Congress and Gandhi. It was ignored by mo

ndra Nath Sircar, Sir Purshottamdas Thakurdas, Muhammad Zafarullah Khan. Again, like in the two previous conferences, little was achieved. The recommendations were published in a White Paper in March 1933 and debated in the British Parliament afterwards. A Joint Select Committee was formed to analyse the recommendations and formulate a new Act for India, and that committee produced a draft Bill in Feb

ruary 1935, which was enforced as the Government of India Act of 1935 in July 1935.  

 Civil Disobedience Resumed On the failure of the second Round Table Conference, the Congress Working Committee decided on December 29, 1931 to resume the civil disobedience movement. During Truce Period (March–December 1931) Some activity during the period March to December 1931 kept alive the spirit of defiance. In the United Provinces,

em who were agitating against the brutal methods of tax-collection by the government. In Bengal, draconian ordinances and mass detentions had been used in the name of fighting terrorism. In September 1931, there was a firing incident on political prisoners in Hijli Jail. Changed Government Attitude After Second RTC The higher British officials had drawn their own lessons from the Delhi Pact which they

ld not be allowed to consolidate itself in rural areas. After the CWC decided to resume the civil disobedience movement, Viceroy Willingdon refused a meeting with Gandhi on December 31. On January 4, 1932, Gandhi was arrested.  

Alwar. But this phase of the movement could not be sustained for long because: (i) Gandhi and other leaders had no time to build up the tempo; and (ii) the masses were not prepared. Finally, in April 1934, Gandhi decided to withdraw the civil disobedience movement. Though people had been cowed down by a superior force, they had not lost political faith in the Congress—they had won freedom in their hea

rts. Communal Award and Poona Pact The Communal Award was announced by the British prime minister, Ramsay MacDonald, on August 16, 1932. The Communal Award, based on the findings of the Indian Franchise Committee (also called the Lothian Committee), established separate electorates and reserved seats for minorities, including the dep

der electorate through universal franchise, while expressing no objection to the demand for a larger number of reserved seats. And to press his demands, he went on an indefinite fast on September 20, 1932. Now leaders of various persuasions, including B.R. Ambedkar, M.C. Rajah, and Madan Mohan Malaviya got together to hammer out a compromise contained in the Poona Pact. Poona Pact Signed by B.R. Ambed

kar on behalf of the depressed classes on September 24, 1932, the Poona Pact abandoned the idea of separate electorates for the depressed classes. But the seats reserved for the depressed classes were increased from 71 to 147 in provincial legislatures and to 

dia. Joint Electorates and Its Impact on Depressed Classes The Working Committee of the All India Scheduled Caste Federation alleged that in the last elections held under the Government of India Act, 1935, the system of joint electorates deprived the scheduled castes of the right to send true and effective representatives to the legislatures. The committee, further, said that the provisions of the joi

 system of separate electorates, and nullification of the system of joint electorates and reserved seats. Even after signing the Poona Pact, Dr B.R. Ambedkar continued to denounce the Poona Pact till 1947. Gandhi’s Harijan Campaign and thoughts on Caste Determined to undo the divisive intentions of the government’s divide and rule policy, Gandhi gave up all his other preoccupations and launched a whir

lwind campaign against untouchability—first from jail and then, after his release in August 1933, from outside jail. While in jail, he set up the All India Anti-Untouchability League in September 1932 and started the weekly Harijan in January 1933. After his release, he shifted to the Satyagraha Ashram in Wardha as he had vowed in 1930 not to return to Sabarmati Ashram unless swaraj was won. Start

ing from Wardha, he conducted a Harijan tour of the country in the period from November 1933 to July 1934, covering 20,000 km, collecting money for his newly set up Harijan Sevak Sangh, and propagating removal of untouchability in all its forms. He urged political workers to go to villages  

 and work for social, economic, political, and cultural upliftment of the Harijans. He undertook two fasts—on May 8 and August 16, 1934—to convince his followers of the seriousness of his effort and the importance of the issue. These fasts created consternation in nationalist ranks throwing many into an emotional crisis. Throughout h

m of attacking Hinduism. They also offered support to the government against the Congress and the Civil Disobedience Movement. The government obliged them by defeating the Temple Entry Bill in August 1934. Orthodox Hindu opinion in Bengal was against the acceptance of permanent caste Hindu minority status by the Poona Pact. Throughout his Harijan tour, social work and fasts, Gandhi stressed on certain

rased by acts of atonement. Gandhi had little use of legal/ constitutional modes; he looked to morality and thus supported conscience to remedy the evil.

two-stage debate on the future strategy of the nationalists: the first stage was on what course the national movement should take in the immediate future, i.e., during the phase of non-mass struggle (1934–35); and the second stage, in 1937, considered the question of office acceptance in the context of provincial elections held under the autonomy provisions of the Government of India Act, 1935. The Fi

ree perspectives were as follows: 1. There should be constructive work on Gandhian lines. 2.There should be a constitutional struggle and participation in elections to the Central Legislature (due in 1934) as advocated by M.A. Ansari, Asaf Ali, Bhulabhai Desai, S. Satyamurthy, and B.C. Roy among others. They argued that:  

alism or self-serving.” Assuring the leftists, Gandhi said that the withdrawal of the Civil Disobedience Movement did not mean bowing down before opportunists or compromising with imperialism. In May 1934, the All India Congress Committee (AICC) met at Patna to set up a Parliamentary Board to fight elections under the aegis of the Congress itself. Gandhi was aware that he was out of tune with powerful

section was estranged from the Congress because of Gandhi’s emphasis on the spinning wheel as the “second lung of the nation”. The socialists led by Nehru also had differences with Gandhi. In October 1934, Gandhi announced his resignation from the Congress to serve it better in thought, word, and deed. Nehru and the socialists thought that the British must first be expelled before the struggle for soc

, they felt, to gradually radicalise the Congress than to get isolated from the masses. The right wing was no less accommodating. In the elections to the Central Legislative Assembly held in November 1934, the Congress captured 45 out of 75 seats reserved for Indians. Government of India Act, 1935 Amidst the struggle of 1932, the Third RTC was held in November, again without Congress participation. Th

e discussions led to the formulation of the Act of 1935. Main Features The Government of India Act was passed by the British Parliament in August 1935. Its main provisions were as follows: 1. An All India Federation It was to comprise all British Indian provinces, all chief commissioner’s provinces, and the Indian states (princely states). The fede

 category should be 50 per cent of the total population of all Indian states. Since these conditions were not fulfilled, the proposed federation never came up. The central government carried on up to 1946 as per the provisions of Government of India Act, 1919. 2. Federal Level: Executive ● The governor general was the pivot of the entire Constitution.  

ul provincial leaders who would gradually become autonomous centres of political power. Congress would thus be provincialised and the central leadership would get weakened. Nationalists’ Response The 1935 Act was condemned by nearly all sections and unanimously rejected by the Congress. The Hindu Mahasabha Views We framed the Act of 1935 because we thought that was the best way...of maintaining Britis

h influence in India. Lord Linlithgow, viceroy (1936–43) We are provided with a car, all brakes and no engine. Jawaharlal Nehru The process of constitutional advance in India is determined by the need to attract Indian collaborators to the Raj. B.R. To

 and the National Liberal Foundation, however, declared themselves in favour of the working of the 1935 Act in the central as well as at the provincial level. The Congress demanded, instead, the convening of a Constituent Assembly elected on the basis of adult franchise to frame a constitution for inde

pendent India. The Second Stage Debate In early 1937, elections to provincial assemblies were announced, and, once again, the debate on the future strategy to be adopted by the nationalists began. Everyone in the Congress agreed that the 1935 Act was t

gical divide along the left and right lines. Divided Opinion Jawaharlal Nehru, Subhash Bose, and Congress socialists and communists were opposed to office acceptance and thereby in the working of the 1935 Act because they argued that it would negate the rejection of the act by the nationalists. It would be like assuming responsibility without power. Also, it would take away the revolutionary character

 direction to the Congress and preparing for the resumption of a mass movement. The proponents of office acceptance argued that they were equally committed to combating the 1935 Act, but work in legislatures was to be only a short-term tactic since option of a mass movement was not available at the time, and mass struggle alone was capable of winning independence. Capture or

onary forces. Despite limited powers, provincial ministries could be used to promote constructive work. Gandhi’s Position Gandhi opposed office acceptance in the CWC meetings, but by the beginning of 1936, he was willing to give a trial to the formation of Congress ministries. In its sessions at Lucknow in early 1936 and Faizpur in late 1937, the Congress decided to fight elections and postpone the de

lection phase. The Congress resolution was “not to submit to this constitution or to cooperate with it, but to combat it both inside and outside the legislatures so that it can be ended”. In February 1937, elections to the provincial assemblies were held. Elections were held in 11 provinces— Madras, Central Provinces, Bihar, Orissa, United Provinces, Bombay Presidency, Assam, NWFP, Bengal, Punjab, and

and 15.5 million of these, including 917,000 women, actually exercised their franchise, according to reports. Congress Manifesto for Elections The Congress manifesto reaffirmed total rejection of the 1935 Act, and promised release of prisoners, removal of  

 work on Gandhian lines. (ii) Constitutional struggle and participation in elections. (iii) Rejection of constructive work and constitutional struggle— continuation of CDM. ● Government of India Act, 1935 Proposed—an All India Federation; bicameral legislature at the centre; provincial autonomy; three lists for legislation—federal, provincial, and concurrent. At centre, subjects to be administered div

ided into reserved and transferred categories. Provincial, legislators to be directly elected. Early 1937—elections to provincial assemblies held. Congress ministries formed in Bombay, Madras, Central Provinces, United Provinces, Bihar, Orissa, Assam, and NWFP. ● Second Stage Debate Nehru, Subhas, Congre

ceptance. Leftists proposed entry into the councils with an aim to crease deadlocks. Gandhi, in the beginning opposed for office acceptance, but later gave his approval. Congress sessions at Lucknow (1936) and Faizpur (1937) decided to contest elections.  

 Congress politics was confrontation and not cooperation with colonialism. (v) War clouds had started hovering around 1938. (vi) The reactionary second chamber (Legislative Council) dominated by landlords, moneylenders, and capitalists in United Provinces, Bihar, Bombay, Madras, and Assam had to be conciliated as its sup

 ● Administrative work by Indians further weakened the myth that Indians were not fit to rule. The Congress ministries resigned in October, 1939 after the outbreak of the Second World War. The huge Congress victory in the elections had aroused the hopes of the industrial working class; there was increased militancy and industrial unrest in Bo

the Congress was drawn into a closer friendship with Indian capitalists. This resulted in what appeared to be an anti-labour shift in Congress attitudes that led to the Bombay Traders Disputes Act in 1938. The Congress leadership was also faced with another dilemma: how to react to the situation in the princely states— should the Congress support the Praja Mandal movement for greater democracy or not.

 In the meanwhile, the All India Muslim League, annoyed with the Congress for not sharing power with them established the Pirpur Committee in 1938 to prepare a detailed report on the atrocities supposedly committed by the Congress ministries. In its report the committee charged the Congress with interference in the religious rites, suppression 

ngress committees and controlling them. Gandhi firmly believed that the Congress should first put its house in order before the movement could again be launched; UNIT 8 Towards Freedom and Partition (1939–1947) Chapters 22 to 25  

nder Jawaharlal Nehru’s presidency adopted a resolution that the Congress goal would be ‘Poorna Swaraj’, Bose fully endorsed the decision. He was again fully active in the Salt Satyagraha Movement in 1930, forcing the government to arrest him. He was vehemently against the suspension of the Civil Disobedience Movement and the signing of the Gandhi-Irwin Pact in 1931, especially as the government refus

ath sentence for Bhagat Singh and his associates. From all this we get a clear idea that Bose was a man of action and radical ideas. Haripura At the Congress meeting in Haripura, Gujarat, in February 1938, Bose was unanimously elected president of the session. He was firm in his belief that the Congress ministries in the provinces had immense revolutionary potential, as he said in his presidential add

 1939: Subhas Bose Wins but Congress Faces Internal Strife In January 1939, Subhas Chandra Bose decided to stand again for the president’s post in the Congress. Gandhi was not happy with Bose’s candidature. Bose said he represented the “new ideas, ideologies, problems, and 

ident was more of a constitutional one, representative and symbolic of the unity of the nation. They favoured the candidate supported by Gandhi, namely, Pattabhi Sitaramayya. Bose won the election by 1580 votes against 1377; he got the full support of the Congress Socialist Party and the communists. Gandhi congratulated Bose on his victory but also declared that “Pattabhi’s defeat is my defeat”. Now i

t became a Gandhi versus Bose issue. Tripuri In March 1939, the Congress session took place at Tripuri, in the Central Provinces (near Jabalpur in present Madhya Pradesh). It was obvious that all was not well within the Congress. The working committee, the r

uggle was of utmost importance and the Congress was at the time the main organ of this struggle. In the circumstances, Bose saw no option but to resign. He resigned from the president’s post in April 1939. This led to the election of Rajendra Prasad as president of the Congress. The crisis in the Congress had been overcome for the present. In May, Bose and his followers formed the Forward Bloc (at Mak

a new party within the Congress. But when he gave a call for an all-India protest on July 9 against an AICC resolution, the Congress Working Committee took disciplinary action against Bose: in August 1939, he was removed from the post of president of the Bengal Provincial Congress Committee besides being debarred from holding any elective office in the Congress for a period of three years. Among the r

ological Differences Gandhi and Bose had a deep respect for one another despite their hugely differing ideologies. Each appreciated the work done by the other in the national struggle for freedom. In 1942, Gandhi called Bose the “Prince among the Patriots”. When the death of Bose was reported, Gandhi said that Netaji’s “patriotism is second to none... His bravery shines through all his actions. He aim

ll time to come for his service to India.” Bose was fully aware of Gandhi’s importance as a symbol of Indian nationalism and called him “The Father of Our Nation” in a radio broadcast from Rangoon in 1944 even though in the same speech he expressed his own conviction that force was the only way to win freedom from the British. When forced to resign at the Tripuri session, Bose said he would “yield to 

in the beginning, a democratic system would not be adequate for the process of nation rebuilding and the eradication of poverty and social inequality. In an address to students in Tokyo University in 1944, Bose is quoted as saying: “You cannot have a so-called democratic system, if that system has to put through economic reforms on a socialistic basis. Therefore we must have a political system—a State

—of an authoritarian character....” [When Bose proclaimed, on October 21, 1943, the formation of the Provisional Government of Azad Hind (Free India), he held on to his post as Supreme Commander of the Indian National Army, and also named himself head of state, prime minister, 

and minister for war and foreign affairs. He anticipated retaining the position of head of state in a free India. This, say some scholars, indicated the authoritative streak in Bose.] As early as 1930, Bose expressed the opinion that in India there should be “a synthesis of what modern Europe  

n rule, there could be formed “a new India and a happy India on the basis of the eternal principles of liberty, democracy and socialism”. Gandhi’s ideas on government can be found in the Hind Swaraj (1909); it was “the nearest he came to producing a sustained work of political theory”. Gandhi’s idealised state, his Ramrajya—a utopia, in fact—did not need a representative government, a constitution, an

r the basic training he received in the University Unit of the India Defence Force. He volunteered to form a guard of honour during the ceremonial functions at the Calcutta session of the Congress in 1930. And it was done on a massive and grand scale. Bose, in full dress uniform, reviewed his ‘troops’. Gandhi and most of his supporters were uneasy with this display. Gandhi was against the military on 

ure prospered and industry was a decentralised business through small-scale cooperative organisations. He also wanted the participation of people at all levels. In a letter he wrote to Henry Polak in 1909, Gandhi expressed the view that India’s salvation lay in unlearning what had been learnt; he wanted the railways, telegraphs, hospitals, lawyers, doctors, and other modern trappings to be discarded, 

Puja just as Muslims and Christians were allowed to celebrate their festivals. Bose motivated Indians towards freedom struggle through Hindu symbolisms as appropriate for the audience. On December 9, 1930, he called upon the women to participate in the liberation struggle, invoking the imagery of Durga, a form of Shakti, ready to vanquish evil. However, he was not a sectarian. He named his force Azad 

 men should treat women with respect and consideration. However, in the matter of the roles of men and women, Gandhi would be regarded as patriarchal and traditional by present standards. He wrote in 1937: “I do believe that woman will not make her contribution to the world by mimicking or running a race with man. She can run the race, but she will not rise to the great heights she is capable of by mi

micking man. She has to be the complement of man.” Again, in 1940, he wrote: “Whilst both are fundamentally one, it is also equally true that in the form there is a vital difference between the two. Hence, the vocations of the two must also be different. Her duty o

nds. But he did not ask women to walk out of their homes and launch agitations, personal or public, against their plight or a satyagraha within their exploitative domestic environments. He did say in 1940 that domestic slavery of woman is a symbol of our barbarism, and she should be “freed from this incubus”. He also wrote: “Women may not look for protection to men. They must rely on their own strengt

ight and sacrifice for the freedom of India. He arduously campaigned to bring women more fully into the life of the nation. In his presidential address at the Maharashtra Provincial Conference in May 1928, he declared: “The status of women should be raised and women should be trained to take a larger and more intelligent interest in public affairs… it is impossible for one half of the nation to win fr

eedom without the active sympathy and support of the other half.” When, as Congress President in 1938, Bose set up the Planning Commission, he insisted that there should be a separate planning commission for women. This commission was chaired by Rani Lakshmi Bhai Rajawade and was to deal with the rol

e of women in planned economy in future India. Later, in 1943, he called on women to serve as soldiers in the Indian National Army. This was a most radical view. He formed a women’s regiment in the INA in 1943, named the Rani of Jhansi Regiment. Many women were

 a means to enlightenment. Gandhi also wanted the Hindu scriptures to be a part of education as they propounded discipline and self-restraint. He conceived his Nai Talim or basic education for all in 1937. Nai Talim aimed to impart education that would lead to freedom from ignorance, illiteracy, superstition, psyche of servitude, and many more taboos that inhibited free thinking of a free India. This 

ccordance with a clear and definite plan so that as soon as they returned home, they may proceed straight away to build up new industries”. Second World War and Nationalistic Response On September 1, 1939, Germany attacked Poland—the action that led to the Second World War. On September 3, 1939, Britain declared war against Germany and the British Government of India declared India’s support for the w

iceroy and the British Government”. Government Attitude and Congress Ministries’ Resignation The government’s response was entirely negative. Viceroy Linlithgow, in his statement, made on October 17, 1939, tried to use the Muslim League and the princes against the Congress. The government: ● refused to define British war aims beyond stating that Britain was resisting aggression; ● said it would, as pa

rt of future arrangement, consult “representatives of several communities, parties and interests in India, and the Indian princes” as to how the Act of 1935 might be modified; ● said it would immediately set up a “consultative committee” whose advice could be sought whenever required. Government’s Hidden Agenda Linlithgow’s statement was not an aberratio

ng the extraordinary situation to acquire draconian powers. Even before the declaration of the War, emergency powers had been acquired for the Centre in respect of provincial subjects by amending the 1935 Act. Defence of India ordinance had been enforced the day the War was declared, thus restricting civil liberties. In May 1940, a top secret Draft Revolutionary Movement Ordinance had been prepared, a

ecial interests, Gandhi said, “Congress will safeguard minority rights provided they do not advance claims inconsistent with India’s independence.” Congress Ministries Decide to Resign On October 23, 1939, the CWC meeting: ● rejected the viceregal statement as a reiteration of the old imperialist policy; ● decided not to support the war; and ● called upon the Congress ministries to resign in the provi

nces. Debate on the Question of Immediate Mass Satyagraha After Linlithgow’s statement of October 1939, the debate on the question of immediate mass struggle began once again. Gandhi and his supporters were not in favour of an immediate struggle because they felt that the: ● allied cause was just; ● c

Congress organisation, carrying on political work among the masses, and negotiating till all possibilities of a negotiated settlement were exhausted. Only then would the struggle be begun. In January 1940, Linlithgow stated, “Dominion status of Westminster variety, after the war, is the goal of British policy in India.”  

 In its meeting in Allahabad in November 1939, the Congress Working Committee passed a resolution observing that “the course of the war and the policy pursued by the British and the French governments and in particular the declarations made on b

ehalf of the British government in regard to India, seem to demonstrate that the present war, like the World War of 1914–18, is being carried on for imperialist ends, and the British imperialism is to remain entrenched in India. With such a war and with this policy the Congress cannot associate itself, and it cannot co

tituent assembly should be recognised and that it was only through such a constituent assembly that communal and other problems could be tackled. The Ramgarh session of the Congress was held in March 1940 with Maulana Abul Kalam Azad in the president’s chair. All agreed that a battle must be waged but there was disagreement over the form. It was decided to leave the form and timing to Gandhi. But even

 Pakistan Resolution—Lahore (March 1940) The Muslim League passed a resolution calling for “grouping of geographically contiguous areas where Muslims are in majority (North-West, East) into independent states in which constituent units sha

during the war period but the government was not interested. The government came up with its own offer to get the cooperation of India in the war effort. Linlithgow announced the August Offer (August 1940) which proposed: ● dominion status as the objective for India; ● expansion of viceroy’s executive council which would have a majority of Indians (who would be drawn from major political parties); ● s

e first time, the inherent right of Indians to frame their constitution was recognised and the Congress demand for a constituent assembly was conceded. Dominion status was explicitly offered. In July 1941, the viceroy’s executive council was enlarged to give the Indians a majority of 8 out of 12 for the first time, but the British remained in charge of defence, finance, and home. Also, a National Defe

ss came to an agreement with the Muslim leaders. It issued ordinance after ordinance taking away the freedom of speech and that of the press and the right to organise associations. Towards the end of 1940, the Congress once again asked Gandhi to take command. Gandhi now began taking steps which would lead to a mass struggle within his broad strategic perspective. He decided to initiate a limited satya

 demands peacefully. The demand of the satyagrahi would be the freedom of speech against the war through an anti-war declaration. If the government did not arrest the satyagrahi, he or she would June 1941: Germany attacks Russia and Russia is dragged into the War. December 1941: Japan attacks Pearl Harbour.

s and start a march towards Delhi, thus precipitating a movement which came to be known as the ‘Delhi Chalo Movement’. Vinoba Bhave was the first to offer the satyagraha and Nehru, the second. By May 1941, 25,000 people had been convicted for individual civil disobedience. Gandhi Designates Nehru as his Successor The Congress leaders, released in December 1941, in the midst of Japan’s aggressive actio

, and a man who was admired by women. Like Gandhi, Nehru was genuinely an all-India leader, who gave Indians hope—that they could build a more prosperous and peaceful society. Cripps Mission In March 1942, a mission headed by Stafford Cripps was sent to India with constitutional proposals to seek Indian support for the war. Stafford Cripps was a left-wing Labourite, the leader of the House of Commons,

Congress rejec

vement After Cripps’ departure, Gandhi framed a resolution calling for British withdrawal and a non-violent non-cooperation movement against any Japanese invasion. The CWC meeting at Wardha (July 14, 1942) accepted the idea of a struggle. Why Start a Struggle Now The reasons were several: 1. The failure of the Cripps Mission to solve the constitutional deadlock exposed Britain’s unchanged attitude on 

he Indian subjects in South-East Asia exposed the racist attitude of the rulers. 5. The leadership wanted to condition the masses for a possible Japanese invasion. The ‘Quit India’ Resolution In July 1942, the Congress Working Committee met at Wardha and resolved that it would authorise Gandhi to take charge of the non-violent mass movement. The resolution generally referred to as the ‘Quit India’ res

rdar Patel, it was to be approved by the All India Congress Committee meeting in Bombay in August. The Quit India Resolution was ratified at the Congress meeting at Gowalia Tank, Bombay, on August 8, 1942. The meeting also resolved to: ● demand an immediate end to British rule in India. ● declare commitment of free India to defend itself against all types of Fascism and imperialism. ● form a provision

, and a consistent propaganda campaign. The government, however, was in no mood to either negotiate with the Congress or wait for the movement to be formally launched. In the early hours of August 9, 1942, in a single sweep, all the top leaders of the Congress were arrested and taken to unknown destinations. The Congress Working Committee, the All India Congress Committee, and the Provincial Congress 

Committees were declared unlawful associations under the Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1908. The assembly of public meetings was prohibited under rule 56 of the Defence of India Rules. The removal of established leaders left the younger and militant elements to their own initiative. With th

as always reiterated, Gandhi’s mantra of Do or Die represents the militant mood of Gandhi. —Sumit Sarkar Parallel Governments Parallel governments were established at many places: ● Ballia (in August 1942 for a week)—under Chittu Pandey. He got many Congress leaders released. ● Tamluk (Midnapore, from December 1942 to September 1944)—Jatiya Sarkar undertook cyclone relief work, sanctioned grants to sc

hools, supplied paddy from the rich to the poor, organised Vidyut Vahinis, etc. ● Satara (mid-1943 to 1945)—named “Prati Sarkar”, was organised under leaders like Y.B. Chavan, Nana Patil, etc. Village libraries and Nyayadan Mandals were organised,  

eople displayed unparalleled heroism and militancy. The repression they faced was the most brutal, and the circumstances under which resistance was offered were most adverse. Gandhi Fasts In February 1943, Gandhi started a fast as an answer to an exhortation by the government to condemn violence; the fast was directed against the violence of the State. The popular response to the news of the fast was 

g was heightened. ● An opportunity was provided for political activity. ● Government’s high-handedness was exposed. Gandhi got the better of his opponents and refused to oblige by dying. On March 23, 1943 Pakistan Day was observed. Famine of 1943 The horror and inconveniences of war were increased by the famine of 1943. The worst-affected areas were south-west Bengal comprising the Tamluk-Contai-Diamo

isis, and some individuals also tried to come up with constitutional proposals. The Formula C. Rajagopalachari (CR), the veteran Congress leader, prepared a formula for Congress-League cooperation in 1944. It was a tacit acceptance of the League’s demand for Pakistan. Gandhi supported the formula. The main points in the CR Plan were: ● Muslim League to endorse Congress demand for independence.  

gue on these lines, but the fact that a sort of parity between the Congress and the League was decided upon had far-reaching consequences. Wavell Plan Although the war in Europe came to an end in May 1945, the Japanese threat still remained. The Conservative  

 keen to reach a solution on the constitutional question in India. The viceroy, Lord Wavell, was permitted to start negotiations with Indian leaders. Congress leaders were released from jails in June 1945. Why the Government was Keen on a Solution Now 1. The general election in England was scheduled for mid-1945. The Conservatives wanted to be seen as sincere on reaching a solution. 2. There was press

a was to reconstruct the governor general’s executive council pending the preparation of a new constitution. For this purpose, a conference was convened by the viceroy, Lord Wavell, at Shimla in June 1945. The main proposals of the Wavell Plan were as follows: ● With the exception of the governor general and the commander-in-chief, all members of the executive council were to be Indians. ● Caste Hindu

s and Muslims were to have equal representation. ● The reconstructed council was to function as an interim government within the framework of the 1935 Act (i.e. not responsible to the Central Assembly). ● The governor general was to exercise his veto on the advice of ministers. ● Representatives of different parties were to submit a joint list to t

nities among its nominees”. Wavell’s Mistake Wavell announced a breakdown of talks thus giving the League a virtual veto. This strengthened the League’s position, as was evident from the elections in 1945–46, and boosted Jinnah’s position; and exposed the real character of the Conservative government of Churchill. The Indian National Army and Subhas Bose Subhas Chandra Bose was an intrepid man. He had

ways shown a militant streak and reacted violently to any insult of Indians by the Europeans. He passed the Indian Civil Services examination securing fourth position but resigned from the service in 1921 to join the struggle for freedom by becoming a member of the Congress. His political guru was Chittaranjan Das. He became mayor of Calcutta in 1923. He was jailed many times by the British. Once it b

ecame clear to Subhas Chandra Bose that he could not follow Gandhi’s way but that the Congress was determined to follow Gandhi, Bose decided to go his own way to fight for independence. In March 1940, Bose convened an Anti-Compromise Conference at Ramgarh; it was a joint effort of the Forward Bloc and the Kisan Sabha. It was resolved at the conference that a worldwide struggle should be launched 

Bose was arrested in July when he protested and tried to launch a satyagraha against a proposed monument for Holwell in Calcutta. He was released from prison and placed under house arrest in December 1940 after a hunger strike. In January 1941, it was reported that Bose had escaped. On January 26, 1941, he reached Peshawar under the pseudoname Ziauddin, helped by Bhagat Ram. Later it was heard that he

 had left India “to supplement from outside the struggle going on at home”. He was reported to have approached Russia for help in the Indian struggle for freedom from Britain. But, in June 1941, Russia joined the Allies in the war, which disappointed Bose. He then went to Germany. Bose met Hitler under the pseudo name, Orlando Mazzotta. With the help of Hitler, the ‘Freedom Army’ (Mukti Sen

dom Army. Bose came to be called ‘Netaji’ by the people of Germany. He gave the famous slogan, ‘Jai Hind’ from the Free India Centre, Germany. He began regular broadcasts from Berlin radio in January 1942, which enthused Indians. In early 1943, he left Germany and travelled by German and later by Japanese submarines to reach Japan and then Singapore in July of the same year. He was to take over comman

 handed over the Indian prisoners of war to Mohan Singh who tried to recruit them into an Indian National Army. After the fall of Singapore, several POWs were ready to join Mohan Singh. By the end of 1942, 40,000 men were ready to join the INA. It was intended that the INA would go into action only on the invitation of the Indian National Congress and the people of India. The move to form this army ha

ese against Indians in South-East Asia and as a bulwark against a possible future Japanese occupation of India. The INA got a boost with the outbreak of the Quit India Movement in India. In September 1942, the first division of the INA was formed with 16,300 men. With the Japanese contemplating an Indian invasion, the idea of an armed wing of INA seemed more relevant to them. But soon, serious differe

 while Mohan Singh wanted to raise a much larger army. Mohan Singh was taken into custody by the Japanese. The second phase began with the arrival of Subhas Bose in Singapore. But before that in June 1943, Subhas Chandra Bose (under pseudo name Abid Hussain) reached Tokyo and met the Japanese prime minister, Tojo. The role of Rashbehari Bose, another great freedom fighter, should also be acknowledged 

here. He had fled to Japan in 1915 following the failed revolutionary activities. In Japan, Rashbehari Bose eventually became a naturalised citizen. He made a lot of effort in getting the Japanese interested in the Indian independence

kok (also under Japanese occupation at the time) that it was decided to place the INA under an Indian Independence League whose chairman would be Rashbehari Bose himself. He had created the League in 1942 in Tokyo. When Subhash Bose was sought by the Japanese to lead the INA, he was ready for it. He went to Singapore and met Rashbehari Bose, and the latter happily transferred the control and leadershi

p of the Indian Independence League and the INA to Subhash in July 1943. It must be noted that it was on the organisational spadework done by Rashbehari Bose that Subhas Bose could build up the Indian National Army. Subhas Bose became Supreme Commander of the INA on Augu

st 25. (In February 1944, after a collapse of his lungs, Rashbehari’s health steadily deteriorated, and he died on January 21, 1945, aged 58.) On October 21, 1943, Subhas Bose formed the Provisional Government for Free India at Singapore with H.C. Chatterjee (Finance portfolio), M.A. Aiyar (Broadcasting), Lakshmi Swaminathan (Women Department), etc. The famous

is powers. Recruits were trained and funds collected for the INA. A women’s regiment called the Rani Jhansi Regiment was also formed. The INA headquarters was shifted to Rangoon (in Burma) in January 1944, and the army recruits were to march from there with the war cry “Chalo Delhi!” on their lips. On November 6, 1943, Andaman and Nicobar islands was given by the Japanese army to the INA; the islands 

were renamed as Shahid Dweep and Swaraj Dweep respectively. On July 6, 1944, Subhas Bose addressed Mahatma Gandhi as ‘Father of Nation’—from the Azad Hind Radio (the first person to call Gandhi, ‘Father of Nation’). He asked for Gandhi’s blessings for “India’s last war of in

s and arms and being made to do menial work for the Japanese units, and this disgusted and demoralised the INA units. The Azad Hind Fauz crossed the Burma border and stood on Indian soil on March 18, 1944. The INA units subsequently advanced up to Kohima and Imphal. On April 14, Colonel Malik of the Bahadur Group hoisted the INA flag for the first time on the Indian mainland at Moirang, in Manipur (wh

rried out military administration duties at Moirang, but then the Allied forces reclaimed the territory. The INA met the same fate as the Japanese, and all brigades began their withdrawal on July 18, 1944. The steady Japanese retreat thereafter quashed any hopes of the INA liberating the nation. The retreat continued till mid-1945. On August 15, 1945 the surrender of Japan in the Second World War took

 place, and with this the INA also surrendered. On August 18, 1945, reportedly, Subhas Bose died mysteriously in an air crash at Taipei (Taiwan). But when the INA POWs were brought back to India after the war to be court-martialled, a powerful movement emerged in th

Change in Government’s Attitude When the government lifted the ban on the Congress and released the Congress leaders in June 1945, they expected to find a demoralised people. Instead, they found tumultuous crowds impatient to do something. Popular energy resurfaced after three years of repression. People’s expectations were  

 heightened by the release of their leaders. The Wavell Plan backed by the Conservative government in Britain failed to break the constitutional deadlock. In July 1945, Labour Party formed the government in Britain. Clement Attlee took over as the new prime minister and Pethick Lawrence as the new secretary of state for India. In August 1945, elections to central a

nd provincial assemblies were announced. In September 1945, it was announced that a constituent assembly would be convened after the elections and that the government was working according to the spirit of the Cripps Offer. The government’s change attitude w

ent was more sympathetic to Indian demands. 3. Throughout Europe, there was a wave of socialistradical governments. 4. British soldiers were weary and tired and the British economy lay shattered. (By 1945, the British government in London owed India £1.2 billion and was being drained by the US Lend-Lease agreement, which was finally paid off only in 2006.) 5. There was an anti-imperialist wave in Sout

h-East Asia—in Vietnam and Indonesia—resisting efforts to replant French and Dutch rule there. 6. Officials feared another Congress revolt, a revival of the 1942 situation but much more dangerous because of a likely combination of attacks on communications, agrarian revolts, labour trouble, army disaffection joined by government officials and the police in th

e presence of INA men with some military experience. 7. Elections were inevitable once the war ended since the last elections had been held in 1934 for the Centre and in 1937 for the provinces. The British would have had to retreat; the Labour government only quickened the process somewhat.  

 Congress Election Campaign and INA Trials Elections were held in the winter of 1945–46. Election Campaign for Nationalistic Aims The most significant feature of the election campaign was that it sought to mobilise the Indians against the British; it did not just appeal to the people

 for votes. The election campaign expressed the nationalist sentiments against the state repression of the 1942 Quit India upsurge. This was done by glorifying martyrs and condemning officials. The brave resistance of the leaderless people was lauded; martyrs’ memorials were set up; relief funds were collected

dreds of INA prisoners besides dismissing them from service and detaining without trial around 7,000 of them. They compounded the folly by holding the first trial at the Red Fort in Delhi in November 1945 and putting on dock together a Hindu, Prem Kumar Sehgal, a Muslim, Shah Nawaz Khan, and a Sikh, Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon. Another issue was provided by the use of Indian Army units in a bid to restore 

 Congress Support for INA Prisoners ● At the first post-War Congress session in September 1945 at Bombay, a strong resolution was adopted declaring Congress support for the INA cause. ● Defence of INA prisoners in the court was organised by Bhulabhai Desai, Tej Bahadur Sapru, Kailash Nath Katj

verage with daily editorials, distribution of pamphlets often containing threats of revenge, grafitti conveying similar messages, holding of public meetings, and celebrations of INA Day (November 12, 1945), and INA week (November 5–11). The campaign spread over a wide area of the country and witnessed the participation of diverse social groups and political parties. While the nerve centres of the agit

ide a matter concerning Indians. Britain realised the political significance of the INA issue, which with each day assumed more and more of an ‘Indian versus British’ colour. Three Upsurges—Winter of 1945–46 The nationalist sentiment which reached a crescendo around the INA trials developed into violent confrontations with the authority in the winter of 1945–46. There were three major upsurges: 1. Nov

ember 21, 1945—in Calcutta over the INA trials 2. February 11, 1946—in Calcutta against the sevenyear sentence to INA officer Rashid Ali 3. February 18, 1946—in Bombay, strike by the Royal Indian Navy ratings Three-Stage Pattern All three upsurges showed a similar three-stage pattern. Stage I. When a Group Defies Authority and is Repressed In the first in

stance of this stage (November 21, 1945), a student procession comprising some Forward Bloc sympathisers, Student Federation of India (SFI) activists, and Islamia College students, who had joined up with the League and the Congress, tied f

 In the next step (February 11, 1946), the protest was led by Muslim League students in which some Congress and communist students’ organisations joined. Some arrests provoked the students to defy Section 144. There were more arrests an

d the agitating students were lathi-charged. Rebellion by Naval Ratings On February 18, 1946, some 1100 Royal Indian Navy (RIN) ratings of HMIS Talwar went on a strike to protest against: * racial discrimination (demanding equal pay for Indian and white soldiers); * unpalatable food; * abuse by superio

t liberating effect on the minds of people. ● The RIN revolt was seen as an event marking the end of British rule. ● These upsurges prompted the British to extend some concessions: (i) On December 1, 1946, the government announced that only those INA members accused of murder or brutal treatment of fellow prisoners would be brought to trial. (ii) Imprisonment sentences passed against the first batch w

ere remitted in January 1947. (iii) Indian soldiers were withdrawn from Indo-China and Indonesia by February 1947. (iv) The decision to send a parliamentary delegation to India (November 1946) was taken. (v) The decision to send Cabinet Mission was taken in January 1946. But could the communal unity witnessed during these events, if built upon, have offered a way out of the communal deadl

ut actually these upsurges were an extension of earlier nationalist activity fostered by the Congress through its election campaign, its advocacy of the INA cause, and highlighting of the excesses of 1942. These upsurges were distinguishable from the earlier activity because of their form of articulation. These were violent challenges to the authority while the earlier activity was a peaceful demonstr

 Performance ● It got 86.6 per cent of the Muslim votes. ● It captured the 30 reserved seats in the Central Assembly. ● In the provincial elections, it got a majority in Bengal and Sindh. ● Unlike in 1937, now the League clearly established itself as the dominant party among Muslims. In Punjab A Unionist-Congress-Akali coalition under Khizr Hayat Khan assumed power. Significant Features of Elections T

, less than 10 per cent of the population could vote and for the Central Assembly, less than 1 per cent of the population was eligible. The Cabinet Mission The Attlee government announced in February 1946 the decision to send a high-powered mission of three British cabinet members (Pethick Lawrence, Secretary of State for India; Stafford Cripps, President of the Board of Trade; and A.V.

The British strategy of conciliation and repression had its limitations and contradictions. ● After the C

ong the masses. 5. Demands of leniency for INA prisoners from within the army and the revolt of the RIN ratings had raised fears that the armed forces may not be as reliable if the Congress started a 1942-type mass movement, this time aided by the provincial ministries. 6. The only alternative to an all-out repression of a mass movement was an entirely official rule, which seemed impossible now becaus

d for a united and friendly India and an active partner in defence of the Commonwealth, because a divided India would lack in defence and would be a blot on Britain’s diplomacy. The British policy in 1946 clearly reflected a preference for a united India, in sharp contrast to earlier declarations. On March 15, 1946, the Prime Minister of Britain, Clement Attlee said: “...though mindful of the rights o

advance of the majority.” This was a far cry from the Shimla Conference where Wavell had allowed Jinnah to wreck the conference. Cabinet Mission Arrives The Cabinet Mission reached Delhi on March 24, 1946. It had prolonged discussions with Indian leaders of all parties and groups on the issues of: (i) interim government; and (ii) principles and procedures for framing a new constitution giving freedom 

 and the League could not come to any agreement on the fundamental issue of the unity or partition of India, the mission put forward its own plan for the solution of the constitutional problem in May 1946. Cabinet Mission Plan—Main Points ● Rejection of the demand for a full-fledged Pakistan, because:  

 Wavell’s ‘Breakdown Plan’ Wavell presented his plan to the Cabinet Mission in May 1946. It visualised a middle course between “repression” and “scuttle”. This plan envisaged the withdrawal of the British Army and officials to the Muslim provinces of North-West and North-East and handin

he Congress would reject the plan, thus prompting the government to invite the League to form the interim government. Acceptance and Rejection The Muslim League on June 6 and the Congress on June 24, 1946 accepted the long-term plan put forward by the Cabinet Mission. July 1946 Elections were held in provincial assemblies for the Constituent Assembly. July 10, 1946 Nehru stated, “We are not bound by a

 Assembly was sovereign and would decide the rules of procedure). The big probability is that there would be no grouping as NWFP and Assam would have objections to joining sections B and C.” July 29, 1946 The League withdrew its acceptance of the long-term plan in response to Nehru’s statement and gave a call for “direct action” from August 16 to achieve Pakistan.  

 Communal Holocaust and the Interim Government From August 16, 1946, the Indian scene was rapidly transformed. There were communal riots on an unprecedented scale, which left around several thousands dead. The worst-hit areas were Calcutta, Bombay, Noakhali, Bihar, a

rawal and post-imperial links dictated a contrary posture. Interim Government Fearing mass action by the Congress, a Congress-dominated Interim Government headed by Nehru was sworn in on September 2, 1946, with Nehru continuing to insist on his party’s opposition to the compulsory grouping. Despite the title, the Interim Government was little more than a continuation of the old executive of the vicero

y (Wavell overruled the ministers on the issue of the release of INA prisoners in his very last cabinet meeting in March 1947). Wavell quietly brought the Muslim League into the Interim Government on October 26, 1946. The League was allowed to join: ● without giving up the ‘direct action’; ● despite its rejection of the Cab

 as a whole (which would reduce the opponents of Pakistan in Assam and NWFP to a position of helpless minority). 14 Ministers of Interim Government (September 2, 1946–August 15, 1947) 1. Jawaharlal Nehru: Vice President of Executive Council, External Affairs and Common Wealth Relations 2. Vallabhbhai Patel: Home, Information and Broadcasting 3. Baldev Singh: Defence 4. Dr. John M

 14. Jogendra Nath Mandal (Muslim League): Law Obstructionist Approach and Ulterior Motives of the League The League did not attend the Constituent Assembly which had its first meeting on December 9, 1946. Consequently, the Assembly had to confine itself to passing a general ‘Objectives Resolution’ drafted by Jawaharlal Nehru stating the ideals of an independent sovereign republic with autonomous unit

y other means. The Congress demand that the British get the League to change its attitude in the Interim Government or quit was voiced ever since the League joined the Interim Government. In February 1947, nine Congress members of the cabinet wrote to the viceroy demanding the resignation of League members and threatening the withdrawal of their own nominees. The last straw came with the League demand

eir subjection to foreign rule and because of economic underdevelopment. British Policy of Divide and Rule Muslims were generally looked upon with suspicion initially, especially after the Wahabi and 1857 revolts, and were subjected to repression and discrimination by the British government. Also, the introduction of English education had undermined Arabic and Persian learning, which added further to 

the economic backwardness and exclusion of the Muslims from service. After the 1870s, with signs of the emergence of Indian nationalism and growing politicisation of the educated middle classes, the government reversed its policy of repression of Muslims and, instead, decided to ral

another religious community. Side-effects of Militant Nationalism The early nationalists made conscious efforts to remove minority fears. Dadabhai Naoroji, presiding over the second Congress session (1886), declared the intentions of the Congress not to raise socio-religious questions in its forums. In 1889, the Congress decided not to take up any issue opposed by the Muslims. But later, with the comi

 like dips in the Ganga and revolutionary activity with oath-taking before goddesses were hardly likely to enthuse Muslims into these campaigns in a big way. The communal element in the Lucknow Pact (1916) and the Khilafat agitation (1920–22) was too visible to be of insignificant consequences. View Communal harmony could not be permanently established in our country so long as highly distorted versio

 the habit of looking at political questions from a religious point of view. Communal Reaction by Majority Community The minority communalism met with a reaction from the majority community. From the 1870s itself, some Hindu zamindars, moneylenders, and middle-class professionals began to give expression to anti-Muslim sentiments. They went to the extent of declaring that the British had liberated the

mmunal colour by saying that Urdu was the language of the Muslims (which was not historically quite correct). Then came organisations to promote a communal outlook. The Punjab Hindu Sabha, founded in 1909 by U.N. Mukherjee and Lal Chand, opposed the Congress for trying to unite Indians of all colours into a single nation. They argued that Hindus should side with the colonial government in their fight 

against Muslims. The All-India Hindu Mahasabha held its first session in April 1915 with the Maharaja of Kasim Bazar as president. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) was established in 1925. However, Hindu communalism was not a strong force for a long time as the modern secular intelligentsia and middle class among Hindus wielded a greater influence. This was not the case with the Musli

al tendencies was a factor which deterred any effective counteroffensive against communalism. Evolution of the Two-Nation Theory The development of the two-nation theory over the years is as follows: 1887: There was a frontal attack on the Congress by Dufferin, the viceroy, and Colvin, the Lt. Governor of the United Provinces. Syed Ahmed Khan and Raja Shiv Prasad of Bhinga were propped up as an anti-C

an appealed to the educated Muslims to stay away from the Congress, although some Muslims did join the Congress. These included Badruddin Tyabji, Mir Musharraf Hussain, A. Bhimji, and Hamid Ali Khan. 1906: Agha Khan led a Muslim delegation (called the Shimla delegation) to the viceroy, Lord Minto, to demand separate electorates for Muslims at all levels and that the Muslim representation should be com

ed by the Agha Khan, Nawab Salimullah of Dacca, Nawab Mohsin-ul-Mulk, and Nawab Waqar-ul-Mulk to preach loyalty to the British government and to keep the Muslim intelligentsia away from the Congress. 1909: Separate electorates were awarded under Morley- Minto Reforms. Punjab Hindu Sabha was founded by U.N. Mukherji and Lal Chand. 1915: First session of All India Hindu Mahasabha was held under the aegi

s of the Maharaja of Kasim Bazar. 1912–24: During this period, the Muslim League was dominated by younger Muslim nationalists, but their nationalism was inspired by a communal view of political questions.  

 1916: The Congress accepted the Muslim League demand of separate electorates, and the Congress and the League presented joint demands to the government. But the Congress and the League came together as se

parate political entities and the Congress gave political legitimacy to the existence of the Muslim League. 1920–22: Muslims participated in the Rowlatt and Khilafat Non-Cooperation agitations, but there was a communal element in the political outlook of the Muslims. 1920s: The shadow of communal riots loomed l

ing put up a spectacular united front with the Congress, accused the Congress of protecting only Hindu interests. The Congress failed to evolve a suitable strategy to counter the rise of communalism. 1928: The Nehru Report on constitutional reforms as suggested by the Congress was opposed by Muslim hardliners and the Sikh League. Jinnah proposed 14 points demanding separate electorates and reservation

ned the role of secular, nationalist Muslims. 3. Concessions to one community prompted other communities to demand similar concessions. 4. Launching an all-out attack on communalism became difficult. 1930–34: Some Muslim groups, such as the Jamaati- ulema-i-Hind, State of Kashmir and Khudai Khidmatgars  

Khilafat agitation. While the Congress stayed away from two of the three round table conferences held in London to discuss further constitutional reforms, the communalists attended all three of them. 1932: The Communal Award accepted all Muslim communal demands contained in the 14 points. After 1937: After the Muslim League performed badly in the 1937 provincial elections, it decided to resort to extr

eme communalism. There began a tendency to project the Muslims, not as a minority but as a separate nation (in the early 1930s this idea of a separate Muslim nation was proposed by a young Muslim intellectual Rahmat Ali and later developed further by the poet Iqbal). From now onwards, communalism was organised as a mass mov

 upper classes. Vicious propaganda was launched against the Congress by Z.A. Suleri, F.M. Durrani, Fazl-ul-Haq, etc. Extreme communalism was based on fear, hatred, and violence of word and deed. Till 1937, there had been liberal communalism, centred around safeguards and reservations. It was communal while upholding certain liberal, democratic, humanistic, and nationalistic values and the notion that 

 1937–39: Jinnah blocked all avenues for conciliation by forwarding the impossible demand that the Congress should declare itself a Hindu organisation and recognise the Muslim League as the sole representa

tive of the Indian Muslims. March 24, 1940: The ‘Pakistan Resolution’ was passed at the Lahore session of the Muslim League calling for “grouping of all geographically contiguous Muslim majority areas (mainly north-western and eastern India) 

 and Cabinet Mission Plan. Finally, it got what it had aspired for—an independent Pakistan comprising Muslim majority areas of Punjab, Sindh, Baluchistan, North- West Frontier Province, and Bengal in 1947.

 510 CHAPTER 25 Independence with Partition Attlee’s Statement of February 20, 1947 Clement Attlee, the British prime minister, sensing the trouble all around, made an announcement on February 20, 1947. The British House of Commons declared the British intention of leaving the Indian subcontinent. Main Points of Attlee’s Statement ● A deadline of June 30, 1948 was fixed for transfer of power even i

e coalition government in Punjab, as it felt emboldened by the statement. Independence and Partition The communal riots and the unworkability of the Congress- League coalition compelled many in early 1947 to think in terms of accepting the so far unthinkable idea of partition. The most insistent demand now came from the Hindu and Sikh communal groups in Bengal and Punjab who were alarmed at the prospe

ct of compulsory grouping which might find them in Pakistan. The Hindu Mahasabha in Bengal was assessing the feasibility of a separate Hindu province in West Bengal. On March 10, 1947, Nehru stated that the Cabinet Mission’s was the best solution if carried out; the only real alternative was the partition of Punjab and Bengal.  

 In April 1947, the Congress president, Kripalani, communicated to the viceroy— “... rather than have a battle, we shall let them have their Pakistan provided you allow Bengal and Punjab to be partitioned in a fair

 to decide things on the spot. He also had the advantage of the firm decision of the British government to quit at the earliest. His task was to explore the options of unity and division till October 1947 and then advise the British government on the form of transfer of power. But he soon discovered that the broad contours of the scenario to emerge were discernible even before he came to India. The Ca

t a serious attempt at unity would involve supporting those forces which wanted a unified India and countering those who opposed it. Mountbatten preferred to woo both sides. Mountbatten Plan, June 3, 1947 The freedom-with-partition formula was coming to be widely accepted well before Mountbatten arrived in India. One major innovation (actually suggested by V.P. Menon) was the immediate transfer of pow

n either India or Pakistan; (ii) independence for Bengal ruled out; (iii) accession of Hyderabad to Pakistan ruled out (Mountbatten supported the Congress on this); (iv) freedom to come on August 15, 1947; and (v) a boundary commission to be set up if partition was to be effected. Thus, the League’s demand was conceded to the extent that Pakistan would be created and the Congress’ position on unity wa

tbatten’s formula was to divide India but retain maximum unity. Why Congress Accepted Dominion Status The Congress was willing to accept dominion status despite its being against the Lahore Congress (1929) spirit because:  

 keep India in the Commonwealth, even if temporarily, considering the economic strength, defence potential, and greater value of trade and investment in India. Rationale for an Early Date (August 15, 1947) Britain wanted to secure Congress’ agreement to the dominion status. At the same time, the British could escape the responsibility for the communal situation. The plan was put into effect without th

he referendum in NWFP decided in favour of Pakistan, the Provincial Congress refraining from the referendum. Baluchistan and Sindh threw in their lot with Pakistan. Indian Independence Act On July 5, 1947 the British Parliament passed the Indian Independence Act which was based on the Mountbatten Plan, and the Act got royal assent on July 18, 1947. The Act was implemented on August 15, 1947. The Act p

rovided for the creation of two independent dominions of India and Pakistan with effect from August 15, 1947. Each dominion was to have a governor general to be responsible for the effective operation of the Act. The constituent assembly of the each new dominion was to exercise the powers of the legislature

 transitional period, i.e., till a new constitution was adopted by each dominion, the governments of the two dominions were to be carried on in accordance with the Government of India Act, 1935. As per the provisions of the Indian Independence Act, 1947, Pakistan became independent on August 14 while India got its freedom on August 15, 1947. M.A. Jinnah became the first Governor General of 

the necessary link, but Jinnah wanted the position for himself in Pakistan; ● there was a delay in announcing the Boundary Commission Award (under Radcliffe); though the award was ready by August 12, 1947, Mountbatten decided to make it public after August 15 so that the British could escape all responsibility of disturbances. Integration of States During 1946–47, there was a new upsurge of the State 

People’s Movement demanding political rights and elective Plan Balkan Between March and May of 1947, Mountbatten decided that the Cabinet Mission Plan had become untenable and formulated an alternative plan. This plan envisaged the transfer of power to separate provinces (or to a confederation, if 

 representation in the Constituent Assembly. Nehru presided over the All India State People’s Conference sessions in Udaipur (1945) and Gwalior (April 1947). He declared that the states refusing to join the Constituent Assembly would be treated as hostile. In July 1947, Vallabhbhai Patel took charge of the new States Department. Under Patel, the incorpo

ration of Indian states took place in two phases with a skilful combination of baits and threats of mass pressure in both. Phase I By August 15, 1947, all states except Kashmir, Hyderabad, and Junagarh had signed an instrument of accession with the Indian government, acknowledging central authority over defence, external affairs, and communication

alkanisation of the country. ● Acceptance of partition was only a final act of the process of step-by-step concessions to the League’s championing of a separate Muslim state. — During Cripps Mission (1942), autonomy of Muslim majority provinces was accepted. — During Gandhi-Jinnah talks (1944), Gandhi accepted the right of self-determination of Muslim-majority provinces. — After the Cabinet Mission Pl

an (1946), Congress conceded the possibility of Muslim majority provinces setting up a separate constituent assembly. Later, the Congress accepted, without demur, that grouping was compulsory (December 1946).

 — Official reference to Pakistan came in March 1947, when CWC resolution stated that Punjab (and by implication, Bengal) must be partitioned if the country was divided. — With the 3rd June Plan, Congress accepted partition. ● While loudly asserting th

 The communalism of the 1920s and the 1930s was different from that of the 1940s. Now it was an all-out effort for an assertive ‘Muslim nation’. Congress leadership underestimated the potential of this type of communalism. Gandhi’s Helplessness Gandhi felt helpless because there

it. How could there be a movement to fight communalism involving a communalised people? He asked the Congressmen, however, not to accept it in their hearts. Summary ● Attlee’s Statement (February 20, 1947) June 30, 1948 as deadline for transfer of power Power may be transferred to one centre or in some areas to existing provincial governments. ● Mountbatten Plan June 3, 1947 Punjab and Bengal Assembli

 CHAPTER 26 Constitutional, Administrative, and Judicial Developments The establishment of the East India Company in 1600 and its transformation into a ruling body from a trading one in 1765 had little immediate impact on Indian polity and governance. But the period between 1773 and 1858 under the Company rule, and then under the British Crown till 1947, witnessed a plethora of constitut

 introduced elements of the modern State into India’s political and administrative system. Constitutional Development between 1773 and 1858 After the Battle of Buxar (1764), the East India Company got the Diwani (right to collect revenue) of Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa. An annual subsidy was to be paid to the Mughal Emperor, Shah Alam II, and an annual pension to the Naw

ab of Awadh, Shuja-ud-Daula. The Company appointed two Indians as the deputy diwans—Mohammad Reza Khan for Bengal and Raja Shitab Rai for Bihar. 1767 The first intervention in Indian affairs by the British government came in 1767. It demanded 10 per cent share in the plunder, amounting to 4 million pounds annually. 1765–72 The dual system of gover

lourishing. By now the British government decided to regulate the Company to bring some order into its business. From now, there would be a gradual increase in controlling laws. The Regulating Act of 1773 ● The 1773 Regulating Act brought about the British government’s involvement in Indian affairs in the effort to control and regulate the functioning of the East India Company. It recognised that the 

problems. ● The governor general could exercise some powers over Bombay and Madras—again, a vague provision which created many problems. The whole scheme was based on checks and balances. Amendments (1781) ● The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court was defined—within Calcutta, it was to administer the personal law of the defendant. ● The servants of the government were immune if they did anything while d

ischarging their duties. ● Social and religious usages of the subjects were to be honoured. Pitt’s India Act of 1784 ● The Pitt’s India Act gave the British government a large measure of control over the Company’s affairs. In fact, the Company became a subordinate department of the State. The Company’s territories 

der-in-chief), and the presidencies of Bombay and Madras were made subordinate to the governor general. ● A general prohibition was placed on aggressive wars and treaties (breached often). The Act of 1786 ● Cornwallis wanted to have the powers of both the governor general and the commander-in-chief. The new act conceded this demand and also gave him the power. ● Cornwallis was allowed to override the 

council’s decision if he owned the responsibility for the decision. Later, this provision was extended to all the governors general. The Charter Act of 1793 ● The act renewed the Company’s commercial privileges for the next 20 years. ● The Company, after paying the necessary expenses, interest, dividends, salaries, etc., from the Indian revenues, was to 

dministration was separated from the judiciary functions, and this led to disappearing of the Maal Adalats. ● The Home Government members were to be paid out of Indian revenues, which continued up to 1919. The Charter Act of 1813 In England, the business interests were pressing for an end to the Company’s monopoly over trade in India because of a spirit of laissez-faire and the continental system by N

apoleon by which the European ports were closed for Britain. The 1813 Act sought to redress these grievances:  

 and direction of the Board of Control was not only defined but also enlarged considerably. ● Christian missionaries were also permitted to come to India and preach their religion. The Charter Act of 1833 ● The lease of 20 years to the Company was further extended. Territories of India were to be governed in the name of the Crown. ● The Company’s monopoly over trade with China and in tea also ended. ●

med the sheet-anchor of political agitation in India.) ● The administration was urged to take steps to ameliorate the conditions of slaves and to ultimately abolish slavery. (Slavery was abolished in 1843.) The Charter Act of 1853 ● The Company was to continue possession of territories unless the Parliament provided otherwise. ● The strength of the Court of Directors was reduced to 18. ● The Company’s

 needed the assent of the governor general, and the governor general could veto any bill of the legislative council. The Act for Better Government of India 1858 The 1857 revolt had exposed the Company’s limitations in administering under a complex situation. Till then, there had not been much accountability. The 1858 Act sought to rectify this anomaly: ● India was to

thority, increased). The assumption of power by the Crown was one of formality rather than substance. It gave a decent burial to an already dead horse—the Company’s administration. Developments after 1858 till Independence Indian Councils Act 1861 ● The 1861 Act marked an advance in that the principle of representatives of non-officials in legislative bodies became accepted; laws were to be made after

 However, the legislative councils established by the Act of 1861 possessed no real powers and had many weaknesses. The councils could not discuss important matters and no financial matters at all without the previous approval of government. They had no control ove

 viceroy’s approval. Even if approved by the viceroy, the secretary of state could disallow a legislation. Indians associated as non-officials were members of elite sections only. Indian Councils Act 1892 ● In 1885, the Indian National Congress was founded. The Congress saw reform of the councils as the “root of all other reforms”. It was in response to the Congress demand that the legislative council

s be expanded that the number of non-official members was increased both in the central (Imperial) and provincial legislative councils by the Indian Councils Act, 1892. ● The Legislative Council of the Governor General (or the Indian Legislative Council, as it came to be known) was enlarged. ● The universities, district boards, municipalities, zamindars, trade bodi

th to be made on the floor of the legislatures. ● They could also put questions within certain limits to the executive on matters of public interest after giving six days’ notice. Indian Councils Act 1909 ● Popularly known as the Morley-Minto Reforms, the act made the first attempt to bring in a representative and popular element in the governance of the country. ● The strength of the Imperial Legisla

on for Muslim voters was kept lower than that for Hindus. The system of election was very indirect. Thus, the representation of the people at large remained remote and unreal. Government of India Act 1919 This act was based on what are popularly known as the Montague-Chelmsford Reforms. In August 1917, the British government for the first time declared that its objective was to gradually introduce res

ponsible government in India, but as an integral part of the British Empire. The Act of 1919, clarified that there would be only a gradual development of self-governing institutions in India and that the British Parliament—and not self-determination of the people of India—would determine the

 time and manner of each step along the path of constitutional progress. ● Under the 1919 Act, the Indian Legislative Council at the Centre was replaced by a bicameral system consisting of a Council of State (Upper House) and a Legislative Assembly (Lower House). Each house was to have a 

 the high commissioner. ● The Secretary of State for India who used to get his pay from the Indian revenue was now to be paid by the British Exchequer, thus undoing an injustice in the Charter Act of 1793. ● Though Indian leaders for the first time got some administrative experience in a constitutional set-up under this act, there was no fulfilment of the demand for responsible government. Though a me

e power to secure the enactment of laws which he considered essential for the safety, tranquility, or interests of British India, or any part of British India. The Indian legislature under the Act of 1919 was only a non-sovereign law-making body and was powerless before  

 the executive in all spheres of governmental activity, as Subhash Kashyap observes. Simon Commission The 1919 Act had provided that a Royal Commission would be appointed 10 years after the act to report on its working. In November 1927, two years before schedule, the British government announced the appointm

ent of such a commission—the Indian Statutory Commission. The commission submitted its report in 1930. It recommended that dyarchy be abolished, responsible government be extended in the provinces, a federation of British India and the Princely States be established, and that communal electorates be 

. Three Round Table Conferences were called by the British government to consider the proposals. Subsequently, a White Paper on Constitutional Reforms was published by the British government in March 1933 containing provisions for a federal set-up and provincial autonomy. A joint committee of the Houses of the British Parliament was set up under Lord Linlithgow to further consider the scheme. Its repo

rt submitted in 1934 said that a federation would be set up if at least 50 per cent of the princely states were ready to join it. The bill prepared on the basis of this report was passed by the British Parliament to beco

me the Government of India Act of 1935. Government of India Act 1935 ● The act, with 321 articles and 10 schedules, contemplated the establishment of an All-India Federation in which Governors’ Provinces and the Chief Commissioners’ Provinces and those Indian states w

d classes, women, and labour. ● Franchise was extended, with about 10 per cent of the total population getting the right to vote. ● The act also provided for a Federal Court (which was established in 1937), with original and appellate powers, to interpret the 1935 Act and settle inter-state disputes, but the Privy Council in London was to dominate this court. ● The India Council of the Secretary of St

ia Federation as visualised in the act never came into being because of the opposition from different parties of India. The British government decided to introduce the provincial autonomy on April 1, 1937, but the Central government continued to be governed in accordance with the 1919 Act, with minor amendments. The operative part of the Act of 1935 remained in force till August 15, 1947. The 1935 Act

reserved for the British Parliament. Extension of the system of communal electorates and representation of various interests promoted separatist tendencies— culminating in the partition of India. The 1935 Act was condemned by nearly all sections and unanimously rejected by the Congress. The Congress demanded, instead, convening of a Constituent Assembly elected on the basis of adult franchise to frame

 a constitution for independent India. Various other developments took place after the 1935 Act. There was the August Offer of 1940, the Cripps Proposals of 1942, the C.R. Formula of 1944 trying to seek the cooperation of the Muslim League, the Wavell Plan of 1945, and the Cabinet Mission. Then came the Mountbatten Plan in 1947 and finally the Indian Independence Act, 1947. [These dev

rs from those people employed in the military and naval services. Gradually, the civil servants were bestowed with other responsibilities and authority. Cornwallis’ Role Cornwallis (governor general, 1786–93) was the first to bring into existence and organise the civil services. He tried to check corruption through: ● raising the civil servants’ salary; ● strict enforcement of rules against private tr

 ● debarring civil servants from taking presents, bribes etc.; and ● enforcing promotions through seniority. Wellesley’s Role In 1800, Wellesley (governor general, 1798–1805) set up the Fort William College for training of new recruits. In 1806, Wellesley’s college was disapproved by the Court of Directors and instead the East India College was set up at Haileybury in En

gland to impart two years’ training to the recruits. Charter Act of 1853 The 1853 Charter Act ended the Company’s patronage, enjoining recruitment to be through an open competition henceforth. The Indians, however, were barred from high posts from the very beginning. Cornwallis th

ought, “Every native of Hindustan is corrupt.” The Charter Act of 1793 had reserved all posts worth 500 pounds per annum for the covenanted servants of the Company. The reasons for exclusion of Indians were: ● the belief that only the English could establish administrat

 and insensitive to the British interests; ● the fact that there was high competition among the Europeans themselves for lucrative posts, so why offer them to the Indians. Although the Charter Act of 1833 theoretically threw open the services to the Indians, the relevant provisions were never really implemented. After 1857, when the Indians claimed a share in higher services, the Proclamation of 1858 

declared the British intention of including the Indians, freely and impartially, in offices under the civil service. Indian Civil Service Act of 1861 This act reserved certain offices for convenanted civil servants, but the examination was held in England in the English language, based on classical learning of Greek and Latin. The maximum permissi

 from 23 (in 1859) to 22 (in 1860) to 21 (in 1866) and to 19 (1878). In 1863, Satyendra Nath Tagore became the first Indian to qualify for the Indian Civil Service. Statutory Civil Service In 1878–79, Lytton introduced the Statutory Civil Service consisting of one-sixth of covenanted posts to be filled by Indians of high families through nominations by local governments subject to approval by 

the secretary of State and the viceroy. But the system failed and was abolished. Congress Demand and Aitchison Committee The Indian National Congress raised the demand, after it was set up in 1885, for: ● lowering of age limit for recruitment, and ● holding the examination simultaneously in India and Britain. The Aitchison Committee on Public Services (1886), set up by Dufferin, recommended: ●

to Imperial Indian Civil Service (examination in England), Provincial Civil Service (examination in India), and Subordinate Civil Service (examination in India); and ● raising the age limit to 23. In 1893, the House of Commons in England passed a resolution supporting holding of simultaneous examination in India and England, but the resolution was never implemented. Kimberley, the secretary of state, 

said, “It is indispensable that an adequate number of members of civil service shall always be Europeans.” Montford Reforms 1919 The Montford reforms: ● stated a realistic policy—“If a responsible government is to be established in India, the more Indians we can employ in public service, the better;”  

● recommended holding of simultaneous examination in India and England; and ● recommended that one-third of recruitments be made in India itself—to be raised annually by 1.5 per cent. Lee Commission (1924) The Lee Commission recommended that: ● the secretary of state should continue to recruit the ICS, the Irrigation branch of the Service of Engineers, the Indian Forest Service, etc.; ● the recruitmen

S on the basis of 50:50 parity between the Europeans and the Indians be reached in 15 years; and ● a Public Service Commission be immediately established (as laid down in the Government of India Act, 1919). Government of India Act, 1935 The 1935 Act recommended the establishment of a Federal Public Service Commission and Provincial Public Service Commission under their spheres. But the positions of co

 in the civil service as in other spheres of governance. This was done in mainly two ways. Firstly, although Indians had begun to enter the coveted ranks of the Indian Civil Services (ICS) ever since 1863, entering the civil services was still extremely difficult for the Indians. The entrance examination for the ICS was held  

 in London in English medium only, and the subjects included classical Greek and Latin learning. Moreover, the maximum age for appearing at the examination was reduced from 23 in 1859 to 19 in 1878 under Lytton. Secondly, all key positions of power and authority and those which were well-paid were occupied by the Europeans. Though a slow process of Indianisation occurred after 1918 under nation

ly revenue collectors but had to contend with rebels, if any. The kotwal was responsible for maintenance of law and order in the cities. Even during the dual rule in Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa between 1765 and 1772, the zamindars were expected to maintain the staff including thanedars for law and order duties and for maintaining peace, as well as dealing with crime and criminals. But very often, the za

midars neglected their duties. They are even said to have colluded with dacoits and shared their loot. In 1770, the institution of the faujdar and amils were abolished. However, in 1774, Warren Hastings restored the institution of faujdars and asked the zamindars to assist them in suppression of dacoits, violence, and disorder. In 1775, faujdar thanas were established in the major t

 1791 Cornwallis organised a regular police force to maintain law and order by going back to and modernising the old Indian system of thanas (circles) in a district under a daroga (an Indian) and a superin

tendent of police (SP) at the head of a district. He relieved the zamindars of their police duties. 1808 Mayo appointed an SP for each division helped by a number of spies (goyendas), but these spies committed depredations on local people. 1814 By an order of the Court of Directors, the appointment of d

arogas and their subordinates was abolished in all possessions of the Company except in Bengal. Bentinck (governor general, 1828–35) abolished the office of the SP. The collector/magistrate was now to head the police force in his jurisdiction, and the commissioner in each division was to act as the SP. This arrangement resulte

d police force, putting a heavy burden on the collector/magistrate. Presidency towns were the first to have the duties of collector/magistrate separated. The recommendations of the Police Commission (1860) led to the Indian Police Act, 1861. The commission recommended: ● A system of civil constabulary—maintaining the village set-up in the present form (a village watchman maintained by the village) but

hile dealing with the public, the attitude of the police was unsympathetic. The police was also used to suppress the national movement. The British did not create an All-India Police. The Police Act, 1861 presented the guidelines for a police setup in the provinces. The ranks were uniformly introduced all over the country. 1902-03 When Curzon was the governor general, the Police Commission set up unde

tached to the Government of India, and it became the central domestic and foreign intelligence agency. Criminal investigation departments (CIDs) were set up in all the provinces of British India. (In 1929, the CID was divided into Special Branch, CID, and the Crime Branch). In the years that followed, the Indian police developed as an agency of the government to help sustain the huge structure of the 

the police was clear. In the process, the police lost the empathy of the Indian masses. Military Under the British The military was the backbone of the Company’s rule in India. Prior to the revolt of 1857, there were two separate sets of military forces under the British control, which operated in India. The first set of units, known as the Queen’s army, were the serving troops on duty in India. The o

Company’s troops—a mixture of European regiments of Britons and Native regiments recruited locally from India but with British officers. The Queen’s army was part of the Crown’s military force. After 1857, there was a systematic reorganisation of the army since, as Dufferin warned in December 1888, “...the British should always remember the lessons which were learnt with such terrible experience 30 ye

on was to be used as an army of occupation—the ultimate guarantee of British hold over India. To begin with, domination of the European branch over the Indian branches was ensured. The commissions of 1859 and 1879 insisted on the principle of a one-third white army (as against 14 per cent before 1857). Finally, the proportion of Europeans to Indians was carefully fixed at one to two in the Bengal Army

 Strict European monopoly over key geographical locations and departments, such as artillery, tanks, and armed corps, was maintained. Even the rifles given to Indians were of an inferior quality till 1900, and Indians were not allowed in these high-tech departments till the Second World War. No Indians were allowed in the officer rank, and the highest rank an Indian could reach till 1914 was that of a

 subedar (only from 1918 onwards were Indians allowed in the commissioned ranks). As late as 1926, the Indian Sandhurst Committee was visualising a 50 per cent Indianised officer cadre for 1952! The Indian branch was reorganised on the basis of the policy of balance and counterpoise or divide and rule. The 1879 Army Commission had emphasised—“Next to the grand counterpoise of a sufficient E

natives against natives.” An ideology of ‘martial races’ and ‘non-martial races’, which assumed that good soldiers could come only from some specific communities, developed particularly from the late 1880s, under Lord Roberts, the commander-in-chief from 1887 to 1892. It was used to justify a discriminatory recruitment policy directed towards Sikhs, Gurkhas, and Pathans who had assisted in the suppres

sing justice could be arbitrary. The beginning of a common law system, based on recorded judicial precedents, can be traced to the establishment of ‘Mayor’s Courts’ in Madras, Bombay, and Calcutta in 1726 by the East India Company. With the Company’s transformation from a trading company into a ruling power, new elements of judicial system replaced the existing Mughal legal system. A brief survey of t

 Reforms under Warren Hastings (1772–85) ● District Diwani Adalats were established in districts to try civil disputes. These adalats were placed under the collector and had Hindu law applicable for Hindus and the Muslim law for Muslims

 for acquisition of property lay to the Sadar Nizamat Adalat at Murshidabad which was headed by a deputy nizam (an Indian Muslim) assisted by chief qazi and chief mufti. ● Under the Regulating Act of 1773, a Supreme Court was established at Calcutta, which was competent to try all British subjects within Calcutta and the subordinate factories, including Indians and Europeans. It had original and appel

late jurisdictions. Often, the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court clashed with that of other courts. Reforms under Cornwallis (1786–93)— Separation of Powers ● The District Fauzdari Courts were abolished and, instead, circuit courts were established at Calcutta, Dacca, Murshidabad, and Patna. These circuit courts had European jud

diction. — Government officials were answerable to the civil courts for actions done in their official capacity. — The principle of sovereignty of law was established. Reforms under William Bentinck (1828–33) ● The four Circuit Courts were abolished and their functions transferred to collectors under the supervision of the commissioner of revenue and circuit. ● Sadar Diwani Adalat and a Sadar Nizamat 

vinces. ● Till now, Persian was the official language in courts. Now, the suitor had the option to use Persian or a vernacular language, while in the Supreme Court, English language replaced Persian. 1833 : A Law Commission was set up under Macaulay for codification of Indian laws. As a result, a Civil Procedure Code (1859), an Indian Penal Code (1860), and a Criminal Procedure Code (1861) were prepar

ed. Later Developments 1860 : It was provided that the Europeans can claim no special privileges except in criminal cases, and no judge of an Indian origin could try them. 1865 : The Supreme Court and the Sadar Adalats were merged into three high courts at Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras.  

 1935 : The Government of India Act provided for a Federal Court (set up in 1937) which could settle disputes between governments and could hear limited appeals from the high courts. Evaluation Positive Aspects of Judiciary under the British ● The rule of law was established. ● T

yed justice. ● Courts became overburdened as litigation increased. ● Often, the European judges were not familiar with the Indian usage and traditions. Major Changes in Administrative Structure after 1857 Genesis of Administrative Changes: New Stage of Colonialism The British were quick to learn from their experience of 1857—an organised mass action could pose a serious challenge to the existence of B

dministration could give the rulers an opportunity to have a better idea of the customs, traditions, and values of the people they were supposed to rule. This could help them handle more tactfully an 1857-like situation. The second half of the 19th century saw further spread and intensification of the industrial revolution. The emergence of new industrial powers—the USA, Japan, and European countries—

ernmental structure and policies in India were to shape the destiny of modern India in many ways. Administration: Central, Provincial, Local Central Government The Act for Better Government of India, 1858 transferred the power to govern from the East India Company to the British Crown. The Company’s limitations in administering the country in complex situations had been exposed by the  

 revolt of 1857; besides, there was not much accountability. Now, the power to govern was to be wielded through a secretary of state (earlier this power was exercised by Directors of the Company and the Board of Con

answerable to the British Parliament. All initiatives and final decisions rested with the secretary and the council was only advisory in nature. (Thus, the dual system introduced by Pitt’s India Act, 1784 came to an end.) Also, the ultimate power over India remained with Parliament. The Government in India was to be carried on, as before, by the governor general whose prestige, if not authority, incre

effect of increasing the influence of British industrialists, merchants, and bankers over government policy in India. This made the Indian administration even more reactionary than it had been before 1858. By the Indian Councils Act, 1861, a fifth member, who was to be a jurist, was added to viceroy’s executive council. For legislative purposes, the viceroy could add six to twelve additional members, 

sures and give them the appearance of having been passed by a legislative body. The British Government in India remained, as before, an alien despotism. Provincial Government The Indian Councils Act, 1861 returned the legislative powers to provinces of Madras and Bombay which had been taken away in 1833. Later, legislative councils were established in other provinces. The three presidencies of Bombay,

 certain services like police, jails, education, medical services, and roads to provincial governments signified the first step in the direction towards bifurcating central and provincial finances in 1870 by Lord Mayo. Now, the provincial governments were asked to administer these services as they liked. Certain other heads of expenditure like land revenue, excise, general administration, and law and 

justice were transferred to provinces in 1877 by Lord Lytton. Besides this, a provincial government was to receive a fixed share  

 of the income realised within that province from sources like stamps, excise, and income tax. In 1882, all sources of revenue were divided into three groups—general (going entirely to centre), provincial (going entirely to the provinces), and those to be divided between the centre and the provinces. 

m of British reluctance to draw upon an already overburdened treasury or to tax the rich upper classes. The important stages in the evolution of local government can be identified as follows: Between 1864 and 1868 Local bodies were first formed in this period, but in most cases consisted of nominated members and were headed by  

 district magistrates. Thus, these were seen not more than as instruments of additional tax collection. Mayo’s Resolution of 1870 Financial decentralisation was a legislative devolution inaugurated by the Indian Councils Act of 1861. Apart from the annual grant from imperial government, the provincial governments were authorise

ef and local public works.” The various provincial governments such as in Bengal, Madras, North-Western Province, Punjab, passed municipal acts to implement the policy outlined. Ripon’s Resolution of 1882 The Government of Ripon desired the provincial governments to apply in case of local bodies the same principle of financial decentralisation which Lord Mayo’s Government had begun towards them. For h

n of municipal property, imposition of new taxes, undertaking works costing more than a prescribed sum, framing rules and bye-laws, etc. In pursuance of this resolution, many acts were passed between 1883 and 1885, which greatly altered the constitution, powers and functions of municipal bodies in India. But, an era of effective local self-governing bodies was still a dream unfulfilled. The existing l

he 19th century were a period of imperialism, and the high priest of that creed, Lord Curzon, actually took steps to increase official control over local bodies. Royal Commission on Decentralisation (1908) Pointing out the lack of financial resources as the great stumbling block in the effective functioning of local bodies, the commission made the following recommendations: (i) It emphasised that vill

rnacular schools, otherwise the government should relieve them of any charges in regard to secondary education, hospitals, relief, police, veterinary works, etc. The Government of India Resolution of 1915 This resolution contained the official views on the recommendations of the Decentralisation Commission, but most of the recommendations remained on paper and the condition of local bodies continued t

o be as it was left by Lord Ripon. The Resolution of May 1918 This resolution reviewed the entire question of local selfgovernment in the light of the announcement of August 20, 1917, which had declared that the future direction of constitutional advance was towards grant of responsible government to the people of India, and the first step towards the progressive realisation of t

le of the people with real and not nominal authority vested in them. Under Dyarchy Local self-government was made a ‘transferred’ subject under popular ministerial control by Government of India Act, 1919, and each province was allowed to develop local selfinstitutions according to provincial needs and requirements. But, since finance was a ‘reserved’ subject under the charge of an executive councillo

r, the Indian ministers could not do much work in the sphere of local self-government for lack of funds. The Simon Commission (May 1930) pointed out the lack of progress of village panchayats except in the United Provinces, Bengal, and Madras. The commission suggested the retrograde step of increasing provincial control over local bo

nted on reluctance of elected members to impose local taxes and observed that, generally speaking, the management of finances of local bodies had deteriorated since the introduction of the reforms of 1919. The Government of India Act, 1935 and After The provincial autonomy ushered in by the Government of India Act, 1935 gave further impetus to the development of local self-governing institutions in In

ular ministries, now the funds could be made available for development of local bodies. Further, the demarcation of taxation between provincial and local finance, which prevailed since the reforms of 1919, was scrapped. New acts were passed in the provinces, giving more authority to local bodies. However, financial resources and power of taxation of local institutions remained more or less at the same

 level as in the days of Ripon. Rather, after 1935, certain new restrictions were placed on powers of local bodies to levy or enhance terminal taxes on trades, callings, and professions and municipal property. The provincial governments seemed to hav

e ignored the liberal policy of granting wide powers of taxation to local institutions as recommended by the Decentralisation Commission (1908). [The Constitution of free India directs the state governments to organise village panchayats as effective organs of local self-government (Article 40). The Seventythird and Seventy-fourth Amendment

s are aimed at plugging the loopholes in the structure of local self-governing institutions in rural and urban areas.] Summary ● Constitutional Development between 1773 and 1858 The Regulating Act of 1773; Pitt’s India Act of 1784; the Act of 1786; the Charter Act of 1793; the Charter Act of 1813; the Charter Act of 1833; the Charter Act of 1853; the Act for Better Government of India 1858 ● Developme

 553 CHAPTER 27 Survey of British Policies in India Administrative Policies Contrary to their pre-1857 intentions of trying to modernise India on progressive lines, now the administration adopted blatantly reactionary policies on the pretext that Indians were not fit for self-governance and needed Bri

rinces against states’ people, region against region, province against province, caste against caste, and Hindus against Muslims. After an immediate spell of repression against Muslims, following the 1857 revolt, the authorities decided, after 1870, to use the middle and upper educated classes among Muslims against the rising tide of nationalism, using conflicts over scarce resources in education, adm

 when the nationalist movement was born (Indian National Congress was founded in 1885), the British interpreted the moves as a challenge to their authority and adopted a hostile attitude to such leadership. In fact, from then onwards, they opposed all those who stood for modern educat

against nationalist-minded intelligentsia. Now, the zamindars and landlords were hailed as the ‘natural’ and ‘traditional’ leaders of people. Lands of most of the Awadh taluqdars confiscated prior to 1857 were restored to them. The interests and privileges of zamindars and landlords were protected in opposition to those of the peasants; the former in turn saw the British as guarantors of their very ex

ndian textile industry under conditions of cheap and unregulated labour, they demanded the appointment of a commission for investigation into factory conditions. The first commission was appointed in 1875, although the first Factory Act was not passed before 1881. The Indian Factory Act, 1881 dealt primarily with the problem of child labour (between 7 and 12 years of age). Its significant provisions w

of age prohibited; ● working hours restricted to 9 hours per day for children; ● children to get four holidays in a month; and ● hazardous machinery to be properly fenced off. The Indian Factory Act, 1891 ● increased the minimum age (from 7 to 9 years) and the maximum (from 12 to 14 years) for children; ● reduced maximum working hours for children to 7 hours a day; ● fixed maximum working hours for wo

sts had been quick to use new advancements in press technology to educate public opinion and influence government policies through criticism and censure and later to arouse national consciousness. In 1835, Metcalfe had lifted restrictions imposed on the Indian press. But Lytton, fearing an increased influence of the nationalist press on public opinion, imposed restrictions on Indian language press thr

ough the infamous Vernacular Press Act, 1878. This act had to be repealed under public protest in 1882. After that, the press enjoyed relative freedom for about two decades but was under repression again in the wake of swadeshi and anti-partition movements as restrictions were imposed in 1908 and 1910

on are administratively troublesome. Of the two, the latter is least risky, though it throws anxiety and responsibility upon those on the spot where the friction exists.

 Revenue Policies Agriculture has always been the main occupation of the people in rural India. When the British obtained the Diwani rights of Bengal in 1765, the agrarian economy was the mainstay of other sectors of the economy as well. The policies of the British changed the agrarian structure as they introduced new systems of land tenures and policies 

with little care about the interests of the cultivators. Hastings’ System The rapacity and corruption of the employees of the Company were partly responsible for one of the worst famines in Bengal in 1769-70. When Warren Hastings became the governor general, he adopted the Izaredari system, also called the farming system, to bring some order to the revenue collection. The power to collect land revenue

ivision. (The land, in other words, was ‘farmed out’ to the highest bidders.) The power of revenue collection was for five years at a time (quinquennial settlement). The collection was made annual in 1777. The system resulted in extortion and oppression in the collection of revenue as (i) the contractors were merely revenue farmers interested in their profit and did not care for the peasants’ welfare,

 silk and cotton, for example. The surplus the British expected from the land revenue did not materialise. Permanent Settlement In 1776 itself, Philip Francis, a member of Hastings’ council, recommended a permanent settlement in land revenue. In the end, Lord Cornwallis was sent as governor general with instructions that the land rev

ry under British rule. Introduced in Bengal and Bihar, it was extended to Orissa, Banaras (Varanasi), and northern Madras. Features ● The zamindars were given proprietary rights over their land. ● In 1790, a ten-year settlement of tax to be paid was made with the zamindars, and in 1793, the settlement was made permanent. ● A fixed tax on the land had to be paid by the zamindar, and the revenue was to 

nment. ● The zamindar, as the owner of the land, could sell, mortgage, or transfer it; his heirs could inherit the land along with rights and liabilities. But, under the ‘sunset clause’ introduced in 1794, if the tax due was not paid by sunset  

 of a certain date, the zamindari would be taken over by the government and auctioned, and the rights would be transferred to the new owner. ● Regulations made in 1793, 1799, and 1812 empowered the zamindar to seize the tenants’ property if the rent had not been paid and, for this, he did not need the permission of any court of law. Shortcomings ● The revenue was fixed at a very h

 the revenue could not increase to meet the growing expenses of the Company which was trying to expand its base through wars. Ryotwari System Thomas Munro and Captain Alexander Read, who were sent in 1792 to administer the recently acquired Baramahal region of Madras Presidency, devised a system of collecting directly from the villages, fixing the amount that each village had to  

 pay. When Munro became governor of Madras Presidency in 1820, he introduced the system which came to be known as the Ryotwari System. The most important reason for the adoption of this system, from the Company’s point of view, was that it brought in a larger r

e tax was so high that very often it was beyond the ryot’s capacity to pay. But the ryots were coerced and even tortured to extract revenue. Many ryots were forced into the clutch of moneylenders. In 1855, the Madras Torture Commission Report revealed the practices of coercion, bribery, and corruption by the subordinate officials of the collectorate. It was from 1855 that a scientific survey of land a

w it was decided that the revenue rate would be half of the net value of the produce of the land and the settlement would be made for thirty years. The reformed system of settlement was introduced in 1864 which led to agricultural prosperity and extension of agriculture in coming years although interrupted by two famines in 1865- 66 and 1876-78. In the Bombay Presidency, beginning in Gujarat, the Brit

 1813-14. After 1818, when the British conquered the Peshwa’s territory, the ryotwari system on the Madras pattern was also introduced there, under the supervision of Elphinstone, a disciple of Munro and Governor of Bomb

ay from 1819 to 1827. On the basis of a survey carried out in 1824-28. The state demand was fixed at 55 per cent of the net produce. However, most of the surveys were faulty, and the estimates of produce erroneous, leading to over-assessment. The harassment of the p

easantry reached such levels that the cultivators deserted their fields and large tracts of land remained fallow. Around 1836, Wingate and Goldsmith improved the system. This modified assessment covered most of the Deccan by 1865. Each field was to be assessed on the basis of its soil and location. The land revenue was some

 The high tax and the harassment in collection devalued land value as not many wanted to buy it. Mahalwari System The adoption of mahalwari system in parts of Northern India began to be considered in 1819 when Holt Mackenzie, the secretary to the board of commissioners, recommended this form of the settlement of land revenue. The recommendation was formalised by the Regulation VII of 1922. The complex

 method of survey, high revenue demand, and harsh methods of extraction led to a breakdown of the scheme. The situation was worsened by the agricultural depression of 1828. Even as arrears began to accumulate, land remained uncultivated; and there were few buyers of land. It was in 1833, when William Bentinck was governor general, that the Regulation of 1833 simplified

state share was fixed at 66 per cent of the rental value and the settlement was made for 30 years. Even this rate was too high, so Lord Dalhousie issued fresh directions to the settlement officers in 1855 under which the state demand was limited to 50 per cent of the rental value.  

ettlement system led to the impoverishment and largescale dispossession of the cultivating communities of North India, and their resentment and discontent found expression in the popular uprisings in 1857. ● From the Company point of view, more was spent for the collection than the revenue collected. Overall Impact of the British Land revenue Systems The Mahalwari Settlement, was introduced in about 3

ndlordism as the practice of subletting revenue collection rights came into being. Exorbitant revenue demands led to commercialisation of agriculture. British Social and Cultural Policy in India Till 1813, the British followed a policy of non-interference in the social, religious, and cultural life of the country. After 1813, measures were taken to transform Indian society and its cultural environs be

nservatives remained influential throughout and most of the British officials in India were generally of a conservative persuasion. The Paternalistic Imperialists became influential, especially after 1800. They were sharply critical of Indian society and culture and used to justify economic and political enslavement of India. The Radicals went beyond the narrow criticism and imperialistic outlook of t

 modern progressive world of science and humanism and therefore advocated the introduction of modern western science, philosophy, and literature. Some of the British officials who came to India after 1820 were Radicals. They were strongly supported by Raja Rammohan Roy and other like-minded reformers. But predominantly, the ruling elements in the British Indian administration continued to be imperiali

sential for their propaganda; and — sought business and the capitalist support holding out the hope to them that the Christian converts would be better customers of their goods. British Retreat After 1858, however, the policy of hesitant modernisation was gradually abandoned. However, the Indians proved to be apt pupils and shifted rapidly towards modernisation of their society and assertion of their 

them completely to British authority (the policy of subordinate union). To cultivate these states as a buffer against future political unrest and to reward them for their loyalty during the revolt of 1857, the policy of annexation was abandoned. The new policy was to depose or punish but not annex. Also, territorial integrity of states was guaranteed and it was announced that their right to adopt an h

hen the fiction of Indian states standing in a status of equality with the Crown as independent, sovereign states ended with the Queen adopting the title of Kaiser-i- Hind (Queen Empress of India) in 1876, to emphasise British sovereignty over entire India. It was later made clear by Lord Curzon that the princes ruled their states merely as agents  

e economic impact of British rule follows. Deindustrialisation—Ruin of Artisans and Handicraftsmen One-Way Free Trade Cheap and machine-made imports flooded the Indian market after the Charter Act of 1813 allowing one-way free trade for the British citizens. On the other hand, Indian products found it more and more difficult to penetrate the European markets. Tariffs of nearly 80 per cent were imposed

 textiles so that Indian cloth could no longer be cheap. After 1820, European markets were virtually closed to Indian exports. Cheap British-made cloth flooded the Indian market. The newly introduced rail network helped the European products to reach the remotest cor

is was as much true for the zamindari areas as for areas under Ryotwari and Mahalwari systems. The peasant became landless. Emergence of Intermediaries, Absentee Landlordism, Ruin of Old Zamindars By 1815, half of the total land in Bengal had passed into new hands—merchants, moneylenders, and other moneyed View … for most of the colonial era, the story of India manufacturing was of dispossession, disp

ines became a common feature of daily existence in India. These famines were not just because of foodgrain scarcity, but were a direct result of poverty unleashed by colonial forces in India. Between 1850 and 1900, about 2.8 crore people died in famines. Commercialisation of Indian Agriculture In the latter half of the 19th century, another significant trend was the emergence of the commercialisation 

ercial crops, given the subsistence level at which he lived, while commercialisation linked Indian agriculture with international market trends and their fluctuations. For instance, the cotton of the 1860s pushed up prices, but this mostly benefited the intermediaries, and when the slump in prices came in 1866, it hit the cultivators the most, bringing in its turn heavy indebtedness, famine, and agrar

ian riots in the Deccan in the 1870s. Thus, the cultivator hardly emerged better from the new commercialisation trend. Destruction of Industry and Late Development of Modern Industry Indian industry was steadily destroyed. The destruct

uilding industries. The British ships contracted by the Company were given a monopoly over trade routes, while even the Indian merchant ships plying along the coast were made to face heavy duties. In 1813, a law by the British parliament prohibited ships below 350 tonnes from sailing between India to Britain; this effectively put a large proportion of Bengalbuilt ships out of commission on the Indo-Br

itish trade routes. In 1814, another law was passed under which Indianbuilt ships were refused to be considered ‘British-registered vessels’ which could trade with America and the European continent. So, the decline of the Indi

ndent countries like Germany and Japan. It was only in the second half of the 19th century that modern machine-based industries started coming up in India. The first cotton textile mill was set up in 1853 in Bombay by Cowasjee Nanabhoy and the first jute mill came up in 1855 in Rishra (Bengal). But most of the modern industries were foreign-owned and controlled by British managing agencies. There was 

ctuals of the first half of the 19th century supported British rule under the impression that it would modernise the country based on latest technology and capitalist economic organisation. After the 1860s, disillusionment started to set in among the politically conscious and they began to probe into the reality of British rule in India. The foremost among these economic analysts was Dadabhai Naoroji,

ullivan, President, Board of Revenue, Madras Where foreign capital has been sunk in a country, the administration of that country becomes at once the concern of the bondholders. —The Hindu (September 1889) It is not the pitiless operations of economic laws, but it is the thoughtless and pitiless action of the British policy; it is the pitiless eating of India’s substance in India, and the further piti

 because it was being ruled for British interests. This agitation was one of the stimulants for intellectual unrest and spread of national consciousness during the moderate phase of freedom struggle (1875–1905)—the seed-time of national movement. Till the end of the 19th century, the nationalists had been demanding some share in political power and control over the purse. During the first decade of th

First Stage The Period of Merchant Capital (Mercantilism), often described as the Period of Monopoly Trade and Direct Appropriation (or the Period of East India Company’s Domination, 1757–1813), was based on two basic objectives: (i) to acquire a monopoly of trade with India, against other English or European merchants or trading companies as well as against the Indian merchants; (ii)

 Second Stage Owing to its mode of exploitation being trade, this stage is also termed as Colonialism of Free Trade. It started with the Charter Act of 1813 and continued till 1860s. Soon after the East India Company became the ruler over most parts of India, there was a debate in Britain as to whose interests the newly acquired colony would serve. The newly emerging industrial

After 1850, engine coaches, rail lines, and other railway stores were imported into India at a large scale. (ix) The Indian Army was used for British expansion of colonialism in Asia and Africa. Third Stage The

 third stage is often described as the Era of Foreign Investments and International Competition for Colonies. It began around the 1860s in India owing to several changes in the world economy. These changes were as follows: (i) Britain’s industrial supremacy was challenged by several countries of Europe, the United States, and Japan.

The notion of training the Indian people for selfgovernment vanished (revived only after 1918 because of the pressure exerted by the Indian national movement). Now, the aim of British rule was declared as permanent ‘trusteeship’ over the Indians. The Indians were declared to be permanently im

 587 CHAPTER 29 Development of Indian Press James Augustus Hickey in 1780 started The Bengal Gazette or Calcutta General Advertiser, the first newspaper in India, which was seized in 1782 because of its outspoken criticism of the government. Later more newspapers/journals came up—The Bengal Journal, The Calcutta Chronicle, The Madras Courier, The Bombay Herald. The Company’s officers 

were worried that these newspapers might reach London and expose their misdeeds. Thus, they saw the need for curbs on the press. Early Regulations Censorship of Press Act, 1799 Lord Wellesley enacted this, anticipating French invasion of India. It imposed almost wartime press restrictions including pre-censorship. These restrictions were relaxed under Lord Hastings, who had

 progressive views, and in 1818, precensorship was dispensed with. Licensing Regulations, 1823 The acting governor general, John Adams, who had reactionary views, enacted these. According to these regulations, starting or using a press without licence was a penal offence. Later on, the act was

 Press Act of 1835 or Metcalfe Act Metcalfe (governor general—1835–36) repealed the obnoxious 1823 ordinance and earned the epithet, “liberator of the Indian press”. The new Press Act (1835) required a printer/publisher to give a precise account of premises of a publication and cease functioning, if required by a similar declaration. The result of a liberal press policy was a rapid grow

th of newspapers. Licensing Act, 1857 Due to the emergency caused by the 1857 revolt, this act imposed licensing restrictions in addition to the already existing registration procedure laid down by Metcalfe Act, and the government reserved the right to stop publication and cir

culation of any book, newspaper, or printed matter. Registration Act, 1867 This replaced the Metcalfe’s Act of 1835 and was of a regulatory, not restrictive, nature. As per the act, (i) every book/newspaper was required to print the name of the printer and the publisher and the place of the publication; and (ii) a

uggle by Early Nationalists to Secure Press Freedom Right from the early 19th Century, defence of civil liberties, including the freedom of the press, had been high on nationalist agenda. As early as 1824, Raja Rammohan Roy had protested against a resolution restricting the freedom of the press. The early phase of nationalist movement from around 1870 to 1918 focused more on political propaganda and e

ts very beginning, stood for the freedom of press. The Indian newspapers became highly critical of Lord Lytton’s administration, especially regarding its inhuman treatment to victims of the famine of 1876–77. The government struck back with the Vernacular Press Act, 1878. Vernacular Press Act, 1878 A bitter legacy of the 1857 revolt was the racial bitterness between the ruler and the ruled. After 1858

nt in political controversies while the vernacular press was critical of the government. There was a strong public opinion against the imperialistic policies of Lytton, compounded by terrible famine (1876–77), on the one hand, and lavish expenditure on the imperial Delhi Durbar, on the other. The Vernacular Press Act (VPA) was designed to ‘better control’ the vernacular press and effectively punish an

pre-censorship clause was repealed, and a press commissioner was appointed to supply authentic and accurate news to the press. There was strong opposition to the act, and finally Ripon repealed it in 1882. Repression against Nationalist Journalists Continues In 1883, Surendranath Banerjea became the first Indian journalist to be imprisoned. In an angry editorial in The  

Tilak is most frequently associated with the nationalist fight for the freedom of press. Tilak had been building up anti-imperialist sentiments among the public through Ganapati festivals (started in 1893), Shivaji festivals (started in 1896), and through his newspapers Kesari and Maharatta. He was among the first to advocate bringing the lower middle classes, the peasants, artisans, and workers into 

the Congress fold. In 1896, he organised an all-Maharashtra campaign for boycott of foreign cloth in opposition to imposition of excise duty on cotton. In 1896–97, he initiated a no-tax campaign in Maharashtra, urging farmers to withhold the payment of revenue if their crop had failed. In 1897, plague occurred in Poona. Although Tilak supported government m

read protests against these measures. Overnight Tilak became a national hero and was given the title of ‘Lokmanya’ (respected and honoured by the people)— a new leader who preached with his deeds. In 1898, the government amended Section 124A and added another Section 153A to the Penal Code, which made it a criminal offence for anyone to bring into contempt the  

also led to nation-wide protests. During the Swadeshi and Boycott Movement and due to rise of militant nationalist trends, several repressive laws were passed. Newspaper (Incitement to Offences) Act, 1908 Aimed against Extremist nationalist activity, the act empowered the magistrates to confiscate press property which published objectionable material likely to cause incitement to murder/ acts of viole

e workers and railway workshop workers took on the army in streets and went on strike for days. Lenin hailed this as the entrance of the Indian working class on the political stage. Indian Press Act, 1910 This act revived the worst features of the VPA—local government was empowered to demand a security at registration from the printer/publisher and fortfeit/deregister if it was an offending newspaper,

s required to submit two copies of each issue to the local government free of charge. According to Reba Chaudhuri, “The Press Association of India in a memorandum on the operation of the Press Act of 1910 stated that nearly 1,000 papers had been prosecuted under the act. The total amount of securities and forfeitures which went into the hands of government during the first five years of the act was ne

arly Rs 5 lakh according to another official return made in 1918. Over 500 publications were proscribed under the Act.” During and After the First World War Defence of India Rules were imposed for repression of political agitation and free public criticism during 

 World War. In 1921, on the recommendations of a Press Committee chaired by Tej Bahadur Sapru, the Press Acts of 1908 and 1910 were repealed. Indian Press (Emergency Powers) Act, 1931 This act gave sweeping powers to provincial governments to suppress propaganda for Civil Disobedience Movement. It was further amplified in 1932 to include all activities calculated to undermine gove

Act and Official Secrets Act. At one time, publication of all news related to Congress activity was declared illegal.

, a trading and profit-making concern, took no interest in the promotion of education. Some minor exceptions were efforts by individuals: ● The Calcutta Madrasah was established by Warren Hastings in 1781 for the study of Muslim law and related subjects. ● The Sanskrit College was established by Jonathan Duncan, the resident, at Benaras in 1791 for the study of Hindu law and philosophy. ● Fort William

 College was set up by Wellesley in 1800 for training of civil servants of the Company in languages and customs of Indians (closed in 1802). The Calcutta Madrasah and the Sanskrit College were designed to provide a regular supply of qualified Indians to help the administration of law in the Company’s court, and the knowledge of classica

f Indians in their own religions and they would take to Christianity. Serampore missionaries were, in particular, very enthusiastic about the spread of education. A Humble beginning by Charter Act of 1813 The Charter Act of 1813 incorporated the principle of encouraging learned Indians and promoting knowledge of modern sciences in the country. The act directed the Company to sanction one lakh rupees a

nnually for this purpose. However, even this petty amount was not made available till 1823, mainly because of the controversy raged on the question of the direction that this expenditure should take. Meanwhile, efforts of enlightened Indians such as Raja Rammohan Roy bore fruit and a grant

 was sanctioned for Calcutta College set up in 1817 by educated Bengalis, imparting English education in Western humanities and sciences. The government also set up three Sanskrit colleges at Calcutta, Delhi, and Agra. Orientalist-Anglicist Controvers

guages (vernaculars) for the purpose. Unfortunately, there was a great deal of confusion over English and vernacular languages as media of instruction and as objects of study. Lord Macaulay’s Minute (1835) The famous Lord Macaulay’s Minute settled the row in favour of Anglicists—the limited government resources were to be devoted to teaching of Western sciences and literature  

 capacity to make social analysis—otherwise the content, structure, and curricula of modern education served colonial interests. Efforts of Thomson James Thomson, lieutenant-governor of NW Provinces (1843– 53), developed a comprehensive scheme of village education through the medium of vernacular languages. In these village schools, useful subjects such as mensuration and agriculture sciences were tau

ght. The purpose was to train personnel for the newly set up Revenue and Public Works Department. Wood’s Despatch (1854) In 1854, Charles Wood prepared a despatch on an educational system for India. Considered the “Magna Carta of English Education in India”, this document was the first comprehensive plan for the spread of educ

chers’ training. 5. It laid down that the education imparted in government institutions should be secular. 6. It recommended a system of grants-in-aid to encourage private enterprise. Developments In 1857 universities at Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras were set up, and later, departments of education were set up in all provinces. The Bethune School founded by J.E.D. Bethune at Calcutta (1849) was the fir

st fruit of a powerful movement for education of women which arose in 1840s and 1850s. Bethune was the president of the Council of Education. Mostly due to Bethune’s efforts, girls’ schools were set up on a sound footing and brought under government’s grantsin- aid and inspection sys

run by European headmasters and principals. Missionary enterprises played their own part. Gradually, private Indian effort appeared in the field. After the Crown Takeover Hunter Education Commission (1882–83) Earlier schemes had neglected primary and secondary education. When education was shifted to provinces in 1870, primary and secondary education further suffered because the provinces already had 

limited resources at their disposal. In 1882, the government appointed a commission under the chairmanship of W.W. Hunter to review the progress of  

 education in the country since the Despatch of 1854. The Hunter Commission mostly confined its recommendations to primary and secondary education. The commission: (i) emphasised that state’s special care is required for extension and improvement of pr

 decades saw rapid growth and expansion of secondary and collegiate education with the participation of Indians. Also, more teaching-cum-examining universities were set up like the Punjab University (1882) and the Allahabad University (1887). Indian Universities Act, 1904 The dawn of 20th century saw political unrest. The official view was that under private management the quality of education had det

cational institutions acted as factories producing political revolutionaries. Nationalists accepted the decline in quality but accused the government of not doing anything to eradicate illiteracy. In 1902, Raleigh Commission was set up to go into conditions and prospects of universities in India and to suggest measures for improvement in their constitution and working. The commission precluded from re

porting on primary or secondary education. Based on its recommendations, the Indian Universities Act was passed in 1904. As per the act, (i) universities were to give more attention to study and research; (ii) the number of fellows of a university and their period in office were reduced, and most fellows were to be no

e government. The nationalists saw in it an attempt to strengthen imperialism and to sabotage nationalist feelings. Gokhale called it a “retrograde measure”. Government Resolution on Education Policy—1913 In 1906, the progressive state of Baroda introduced compulsory primary education throughout its territories. National leaders urged the government to do so for British India. Gokhale, as a member of 

the Imperial Legislative Council, raised the issue in his Resolution of 1910; he called for primary education to be made compulsory in those areas where at least 35 per cent of 6-to-7-year-old boys were receiving instruction; state governments and local authorities to decide 

der the central government and appointed a secretary for education, the main demand for free and compulsory primary education was ignored. Gokhale then raised the issue by bringing in a bill in March 1911 calling  

 the introduction of free and compulsory primary education in a phased manner. The bill was, however, rejected by a select committee. The government came up with its Resolution on Education Policy in 1913. The government refused to take up the responsibility of compulsory education, but accepted the policy of removal of illiteracy and urged provincial governments to take early steps to provide free el

cal utility for girls, and that examination of girls should not get much importance; however, there should be an increase in the number of women teachers and inspectors. Sadler University Commission (1917–19) In 1917, the Government of India appointed the Calcutta University Commission, commonly called the Sadler Commission after its chairman, Michael Sadler. The commission was set up to study and rep

attered, affiliated colleges. 4. Female education, applied scientific and technological education, teachers’ training, including those for professional and vocational colleges, should be extended. In 1920, the government recommended the Sadler Report to the provincial governments. The Sadler Commission recommendations had a great influence on the development of education in the next few decades. In th

e period from 1916 to 1921, seven new universities came up: Mysore, Patna, Benaras, Aligarh, Dacca, Lucknow, and Osmani soon after, came more universities such as Delhi, Agra, and Annamalai (in Madras). Teaching so far had bee

sities improved. The Academic Council was created to deal with such matters as curriculum construction, examination, and research. This helped to improve the academic standard of the universities. In 1925, an Inter University Board was set up to coordinate among the different Indian universities. For the first time students’ welfare became an important matter in universities, and a board of students’ 

ontagu-Chelmsford reforms, education was shifted to provincial ministries and the government stopped taking direct interest in educational matters, while government grants, liberally sanctioned since 1902, were now stopped. Financial difficulties prevented any substantial expansion but still education grew, especially under philanthropic efforts. Hartog Committee (1929) An increase in the number of sc

His memorandum was submitted to the Central Advisory Board of Education in 1944.

 Wardha Scheme of Basic Education (1937) The Congress had organised an all India Education Conference in October 1937 in Wardha. In the light of the resolutions passed there, the Zakir Hussain committee formulated a detailed national scheme for basic education. (It came to be known as Nai Talim.) The main principle

of its times. Development of Vernacular Education During the early 19th century, vernacular education was in a sorry state of affairs. It was mostly dependent on contributions from wealthy zamindars. 1835, 1836, 1838 : William Adam’s reports on vernacular education in Bengal and Bihar pointed out defects in the system of vernacular education. 1843–53 : James Jonathan’s experiments in North- West Provi

nces (UP), as the lieutenant-governor there, included opening one government school as model school in each tehsildari and a normal school for teachers’ training for vernacular schools. 1853 : In a famous minute, Lord Dalhousie expressed strong opinion in favour of vernacular education. 1854 : Wood’s Despatch made the following provisions for vernacular education: 1. Improvement of stand

ards 2. Supervision by government agency 3. Normal schools to train teachers These gave impetus to the cause of vernacular education 1854–71 : The government paid some attention to secondary and vernacular education. The number of vernacular schools increased by more than five-fold. 1882 : The Hunter Commission held that State should m

Mass education was to be seen as instructing masses through vernaculars. 1904 : Education policy put special emphasis on vernacular education and increased grants for it. 1929 : Hartog Committee presented a gloomy picture of primary education. 1937 : These schools received encouragement from Congress ministries. Development of Technical Education The Engineering College at

 Roorkee was set up in 1847; the Calcutta College of Engineering came up in 1856. In 1858, Overseers’ School at Poona was raised to the status of Poona College of Engineering and affiliated to Bombay University. Guindy College of Engineering was affiliated to Madras University. Medical tr

aining started with the establishment of a medical college in Calcutta in 1835. Lord Curzon did much to broaden the whole basis of professional courses—medicine, agriculture, engineering, veterinary sciences, etc. He established an agriculture college at Pusa, which acted as a 

anted to use modern education to strengthen the foundations of their political authority in India. 2. Traditional system of Indian learning gradually declined for want of support, and specially after 1844 when it was declared that applicants for government employment should possess knowledge of English. 3. Mass education was neglected leading to widespread illiteracy (1911—84 per cent and in 1921—92 p

 (i) the government did not want to arouse wrath of orthodox sections; and (ii) it had no immediate utility for the colonial rule. 6. Scientific and technical education was by and large neglected. By 1857, there were only three medical colleges at Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras, and only one good engineering college at Roorkee, which was open only to Europeans and Eurasians.

Peasant Movements 1857–1947 ✫ 611

 A Survey of Early Peasant Movements Indigo Revolt (1859–60) In Bengal, the indigo planters, nearly all Europeans, exploited the local peasants by forcing them to grow indigo on their lands instead of the more paying crops like rice. The planters forced th

hrough kidnappings, illegal confinements, flogging, attacks on women and children, seizure of cattle, burning and demolition of houses, and destruction of crops. The anger of the peasants exploded in 1859 when, led by Digambar Biswas and Bishnu Biswas of Nadia district, they decided not to grow indigo under duress and resisted the physical pressure of the planters and their lathiyals (retainers) backe

 them in legal battles. The government appointed an indigo commission to enquire into the problem of indigo cultivation. Based on its recommendations, the government issued a notification in November 1860 that the ryots could not be compelled to grow indigo and that it would ensure that all disputes were settled by legal means. But the planters were already closing down factories and indigo cultivatio

n was virtually wiped out from Bengal by the end of 1860. Pabna Agrarian Leagues During the 1870s and 1880s, large parts of Eastern Bengal witnessed agrarian unrest caused by oppressive practices of  

 the zamindars. The zamindars resorted to enhanced rents beyond legal limits and prevented the tenants from acquiring occupancy rights under Act X of 1859. To achieve their ends, the zamindars resorted to forcible evictions, seizure of cattle and crops, and prolonged, costly litigation in courts where the poor peasant found himself at a disadvantage. H

roughout Pabna and to other districts of East Bengal. The main form of struggle was that of legal resistance; there was very little violence. Though the peasant discontent continued to linger on till 1885, most of the cases had been solved, partially through official persuasion and partially because of zamindars’ fears. Many peasants were able to acquire occupancy rights and resist enhanced rents. The

 government also promised to undertake legislation to protect the tenants from the worst aspects of zamindari oppression. In 1885, the Bengal Tenancy Act was passed. Again, a number of young Indian intellectuals supported the peasants’ cause. These included Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, R.C. Dutt, and the Indian Association under 

loiter and the main beneficiary. These moneylenders were mostly outsiders—Marwaris or Gujaratis. The conditions had worsened due to a crash in cotton prices after the end of the American Civil War in 1864, the government’s decision to raise the land revenue by 50 per cent in 1867, and a succession of bad harvests. In 1874, the growing tension between the moneylenders and the peasants resulted in a soc

 and shops. The debt bonds and deeds were seized and publicly burnt. The government succeeded in repressing the movement. As a conciliatory measure, the Deccan Agriculturists Relief Act was passed in 1879. This time also, the modern nationalist intelligentsia of Maharashtra supported the peasants’ cause. Changed Nature of Peasant Movements after 1857 ● Peasants emerged as the main force in agrarian mo

The Kisan Sabha Movement After the 1857 revolt, the Awadh taluqdars had got back their lands. This strengthened the hold of the taluqdars or big landlords over the agrarian society of the province. The majority of the cultivators were subj

The United Provinces Kisan Sabha was set up in February 1918 by Gauri Shankar Mishra and Indra Narayan Dwivedi. Madan Mohan Malaviya supported their efforts. By June 1919, the UP Kisan Sabha had 450 branches. Other prominent leaders included Jhinguri Singh, Du

rgapal Singh and Baba Ramchandra. In June 1920, Baba Ramchandra urged Nehru to visit these villages. During these visits, Nehru developed close contacts with the villagers. In October 1920, the Awadh Kisan Sabha came into existence because of differences in nationalist ranks. The Awadh Kisan Sabha asked the kisans to refuse to till bedakhali land, not to offer hari and begar (forms of 

hose who did not accept these conditions, and to solve their disputes through panchayats. From the earlier forms of mass meetings and mobilisation, the patterns of activity changed rapidly in January 1921 to the looting of bazaars, houses, granaries, and clashes with the police. The centres of activity were primarily the districts of Rai Bareilly, Faizabad, and Sultanpur. The movement declined soon, p

 Eka Movement Towards the end of 1921, peasant discontent resurfaced in some northern districts of the United Provinces—Hardoi, Bahraich, Sitapur. The issues involved were: (i) high rents—50 per cent higher than the recorded rates; (ii) 

ur; ● give no help to criminals; and ● abide by panchayat decisions. The grassroot leadership of the Eka Movement came from Madari Pasi and other low-caste leaders, and many small zamindars. By March 1922, severe repression by authorities brought the movement to an end. Mappila Revolt The Mappilas were the Muslim tenants inhabiting the Malabar region where most of the landlords were Hindus. The Mappil

aukat Ali, and Maulana Azad addressed Mappila meetings. After the arrest of national leaders, the leadership passed into the hands of local Mappila leaders. Things took a turn for the worse in August 1921 when the arrest of a respected priest leader, Ali Musaliar, sparked off large-scale riots. Initially, the symbols of British  

igovernment and anti-landlord affair acquired communal overtones. The communalisation of the rebellion completed the isolation of the Mappilas from the Khilafat-Non- Cooperation Movement. By December 1921, all resistance had come to a stop. Bardoli Satyagraha The Bardoli taluqa in Surat district had witnessed intense politicisation after the coming of Gandhi on the national political scene. The moveme

nt sparked off in January 1926 when the authorities decided to increase the land revenue by 30 per cent. The Congress leaders were quick to protest and a Bardoli Inquiry Committee was set up to go into the issue. The committee fou

nd the revenue hike to be unjustified. In February 1926, Vallabhbhai Patel was called to lead the movement. The women of Bardoli gave him the title of “Sardar”. Under Patel, the Bardoli peasants resolved to refuse payments of the revised assessment until 

ment faced a social boycott. Special emphasis was placed on the mobilisation of women. K.M. Munshi and Lalji Naranji resigned from the Bombay Legislative Council in support of the movement. By August 1928, massive tension had built up in the area. There were prospects of a railway strike in Bombay. Gandhi reached Bardoli to stand by in case of any emergency. The government was looking for a graceful w

 During the 1930s, the peasant awakening was influenced by the Great Depression in the industrialised countries and the Civil Disobedience Movement, which took the form of no-rent, no-revenue movement in many areas. 

Also, after the decline of the active phase movement (1932), many new entrants to active politics started looking for suitable outlets for release of their energies and took to organisation of peasants. The All India Kisan Congress/Sabha This sabha was found

ed in Lucknow in April 1936 with Swami Sahajanand Saraswati as the president and N.G. Ranga as the general secretary. A kisan manifesto was issued and a periodical under Indulal Yagnik started. The AIKS and the Congress held th

eir sessions in Faizpur in 1936. The Congress manifesto (especially the agrarian policy) for the 1937 provincial elections was strongly influenced by the AIKS agenda. Under Congress Ministries The period 1937–39 was the high watermark of the peasant movements and activity under the Congress provincia

rganisations) came into existence. The most popular method was the marching of jaths or peasants groups to the landlords to get their demands accepted. One significant campaign by the peasants was in 1938 for the amendment of the Malabar Tenancy Act, 1929. Andhra This region had already witnessed a decline in the prestige of zamindars after their defeat by Congressmen in elections. Anti-zamindar movem

 Many provincial ryot associations were active. N.G. Ranga had set up, in 1933, the India Peasants’ Institute. After 1936, the Congress socialists started organising the peasants. At many places, the summer schools of economics and politics were held and addressed by leaders like P.C. Joshi, Ajoy Ghosh, and R.D. Bhardwa

j. Bihar Here, Sahjanand Saraswati was joined by Karyanand Sharma, Yadunandan Sharma, Rahul Sankritayan, Panchanan Sharma, Jamun Karjiti, etc. In 1935, the Provincial Kisan Conference adopted the anti-zamindari slogan. The Provincial Kisan Sabha developed a rift with the Congress over the ‘bakasht land’ issue because of an unfavourable government r

esolution which was not acceptable to the sabha. The movement died out by August 1939. Punjab The earlier peasant mobilisation here had been organised by the Punjab Naujawan Bharat Sabha, the Kirti Kisan Party, the Congress, and the Akalis. A new direction to the movement was given by

 the Punjab Kisan Committee in 1937. The main targets of the movement were the landlords of western Punjab who dominated the unionist ministry. The immediate issues taken up were resettlement of land revenue in Amritsar and Lahore and

 Ranga left the sabha. But the Kisan Sabha continued to work among the people. It did notable work during the famine of 1943. Post-War Phase Tebhaga Movement In September 1946, the Bengal Provincial Kisan Sabha gave a call to implement, through mass struggle, the Flood Commission recommendations of tebhaga—two-thirds’ share—to the bargardars, the sharecroppers also known a

 wartime exactions, abuse of rationing, excessive rent, and vethi. The uprising began in July 1946 when a deshmukh’s thug murdered a village militant in Jangaon taluq of Nalgonda. Soon, the uprising spread to Warrangal and Khammam. The peasants organised themselves into village sanghams and attack

ed using lathis, stone slings, and chilli powder. They had to face brutal repression. The movement was at its greatest intensity between August 1947 and September 1948. The peasants brought about a rout of the Razaqars—the Nizam’s stormtroopers. Once the Indian security forces took over Hyderabad, the movement fizzled out. The Telangana movement had many positive a

Thus, earlier attempts to improve the economic conditions of the workers were in the nature of the philanthropic efforts which were isolated, sporadic, and aimed at specif

ic local grievances. 1870 Sasipada Banerjea started a workingmen’s club and newspaper Bharat Shramjeevi. 1878 Sorabjee Shapoorji Bengalee tried to get a bill, providing better working conditions to labour, passed in the Bombay Legislative Council. 1880 Narayan Meghajee Lokhande started the newspaper Deenband

, and setting up of International Labour Organisation (ILO) lent a new dimension to the movement of the working class in India. The AITUC The All India Trade Union Congress was founded on October 31, 1920. The Indian National Congress president for the year, Lala Lajpat Rai, was elected as the first president of AITUC and Dewan Chaman Lal as the first general secretary. Lajpat Rai was the first to lin

d militarism are the twin children of capitalism”. The prominent Congress and swarajist leader C.R. Das presided over the third and the fourth sessions of the AITUC. The Gaya session of the Congress (1922) welcomed the formation of the AITUC, and a committee was formed to assist it. C.R. Das advocated that the Congress should take up the workers’ and peasants’ cause and incorporate them in the struggl

itish Labour Party. The Gandhian philosophy of non-violence, trusteeship, and class-collaboration had great influence on the movement. Gandhi helped organise the Ahmedabad Textile Labour Association (1918) and through a protest secured a 27.5 per cent wage hike. (Later, the arbitrator’s award ensured a 35 per cent raise.)  

 The Trade Union Act, 1926 The Trade Union Act, 1926: ● recognised trade unions as legal associations; ● laid down conditions for registration and regulation of trade union activities; and ● secured immunity, both civil and criminal, for trade unions f

rom prosecution for legitimate activities, but put some restrictions on their political activities. Late 1920s A strong communist influence on the movement lent a militant and revolutionary content to it. In 1928, there was a six-month-long strike in Bombay Textile Mills led by the Girni Kamgar Union. The wh

ole of 1928 witnessed unprecedented industrial unrest. This period also saw the crystallisation of various communist groups, with leaders like S.A. Dange, Muzaffar Ahmed, P.C. Joshi, Sohan Singh Joshi, etc. Alar

med at the increasing strength of the trade union movement under extremist influence, the government resorted to legislative restrictions. It passed the Public Safety Ordinance (1929) and the Trade Disputes Act (TDA), 1929. The TDA, 1929: ● made compulsory the appointment of Courts of Inquiry and Consultation Boards for settling industrial disputes; ● made illegal the strikes in 

go on strike gave an advance notice of one month to the administration; and ● forbade trade union activity of coercive or purely political nature and even sympathetic strikes. Meerut Conspiracy Case (1929) In March 1929, the government arrested 31 labour leaders, and the three-and-a-half-year trial resulted in the conviction of Muzaffar Ahmed, S.A. Dange, Joglekar, Philip Spratt, Ben Bradley, Shaukat 

Usmani, and others. The trial got worldwide publicity but weakened the working class movement. The workers participated during 1930 in the Civil Disobedience Movement, but after 1931, there was a dip in  

 the working class movement because of a split in 1931 in which the corporatist trend led by N.M. Joshi broke away from the AITUC to set up the All India Trade Union Federation. In 1935, the communists rejoined the AITUC. Now, the left front consisted of the communists, Congress socialists, and the leftist nationalists like Nehru and Subhas. Under Congress Ministries During the 1937

es were generally sympathetic to the workers’ demands. Many legislations favourable to the workers were passed. During and After the Second World War Initially, the workers opposed the War, but after 1941, when Russia joined the war on behalf of the Allies, the communists described the war as a “peoples’ war” and supported it. The communists dissociated themselves from the Quit India Movement. A polic

y of industrial peace was advocated by the communists. In the period 1945 to 1947, workers participated actively in the post-War national upsurges. In 1945, the dock workers of Bombay and Calcutta refused to load ships taking supplies to the warring troops in Indonesia. During 1946, the workers went on a strike in support of the Naval Ratings. During th

 627 CHAPTER 33 Challenges before the Newborn Nation First Day of Independent India August 15, 1947 started an epoch that ended India’s colonial subjugation and looked forward to a new India—India as an independent country. The Constituent Assembly of India met at 11 p.m. on August 14, 1947. Rajend

ra Prasad presided over the session. In a ceremony held in the Constituent Assembly (in Parliament House) at midnight of August 14–15, 1947, Jawaharlal Nehru, speaking as the first prime minister of Independent India, gave his historic speech. Nehru said, “Long UNIT 10 Independence and After Chapters 33 to 39  

es when we shall redeem our pledge, not wholly or in full measure, but very substantially. At the stroke of midnight hour, when the world sleeps, India will wake to life and freedom...” On August 15, 1947, Jawaharlal Nehru, as Prime Minister of India, hoisted the Indian national flag above the Lahori Gate of Red Fort in Delhi. First Government after Independence The governor general and the ministers 

were sworn in. Jawaharlal Nehru took charge as the first Prime Minister of India on August 15, 1947, and was assisted by 15 other members. Sardar Patel served as the deputy prime minister till his death in December 1950. Lord Mountbatten, and later C. Rajagopalachari served as governor-general till

 January 26, 1950, when India became a republic and elected Rajendra Prasad as its first president. The first Council of Ministers of Independent India was as follows: 1. Jawaharlal Nehru: Prime Minister; Minister of 

 Scheduled Castes Federation; resigned in 1951) 15. Shyama Prasad Mookherjee: Minister of Industries and Supplies [Hindu Mahasabha; first to resign from the cabinet in April 1950] 16. Narasimha Gopalaswami Ayyangar: Minister without portfolio; assigned the task to act as a link between the union government and the cabinet of East Punjab government 17. Mohanlal Saxena: Ministe

 to Pakistan received 62,000 square miles of territory and 15.7 million people (census 1941), of whom 11.85 million were Muslims. East Punjab (India’s share) received 37,000 square miles of land area, with a population of 12.6 million, of whom 4.37 million were Muslims. Likewise, West Benga

ly shrines be included in East Punjab (part of India) further complicated the situation. In the face of such legal intricacies, a rational approach gave way to political considerations. The census of 1941, the basis of decisions, was also faulty. So, the resultant boundary lines were bound to create several problems and leave many people unhappy. The report of the Boundary Commission was ready by Augu

 the British government decided to demarcate the boundary and leave the country amidst unrest was a most callous way to behave. Regions Most Affected by Riots The communal riots had started in August 1946 itself, but with the announcement of partition and independence, the situation became more inflamed. The regions through which the Radcliffe Line was drawn became most violent, and maximum number of 

rienced less violence in comparison to Punjab. Riots began in Delhi, with a massacre of Muslims in revenge for Punjab (Gandhian fasts had a temporary impact). In Bihar, prior to partition, in October 1946, Hindu peasants, allegedly instigated by Hindu landlords to divert attention from agrarian problems, killed Muslims. This was followed by violence in Garhmukteswar in the United Province where Hindu 

 Indian Army (August 15–December 31, 1947), the widespread disorder would have been under control if all the personnel from civil and armed services had been placed in their respective new countries. Challenges Associated with Division of Re

im units to India, but due to serious differences between the two parties, the post of Supreme Commander was abolished. Amidst serious chaos, the British troops started to leave India from August 17, 1947 and the process was completed by February 1948. Assassination of Gandhi On the evening of January 30, 1948, as he carried on his usual prayer meeting at Birla mansion (New Delhi), Mahatma Gandhi was 

nt pandering to the Muslims, “culminating in his last pro-Muslim fast [which] at last goaded me to the conclusion that the existence of Gandhi should be brought to an end immediately”. On February 4, 1948, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) was banned by the government. It was felt by the  

the death of Gandhi. Nehru considered that groups such as the RSS had “the blood of Mahatma Gandhi on their hands” even though they dissociated themselves from his killing. The ban was lifted in July 1949, when the RSS accepted the conditions laid down by the government. These conditions were that the Sangh would restrict itself to cultural activities and not meddle with politics; renounce its agenda 

tled in the empty houses of Muslims. (This, at a later time, made the return of the refugees impossible.) East Punjab Some refugees were accommodated temporarily in refugee camps, which were run till 1949. For urban refugees, the government started industrial and vocational training schemes,  

status and political connections—often got the better deal, while the depressed classes were given little or no consideration. Bengal The problem was much more prolonged and complicated in Bengal. By 1948, only a small group of high-caste, landed or middle-class Hindus migrated to West Bengal by arranging exchange of property or jobs on individual levels. But during December 1949 and January 1950, due

 to a fresh outbreak of violence in Khulna, a large number of peasants started to leave East Pakistan. In revenge, anti-Muslim riots started in February 1950 and forced about one million Muslims to leave West Bengal. This further aggravated anti-Hindu violence in East Pakistan and by 1951, about 15 lakh Hindu refugees arrived in West Bengal. But the India

ountries, especially in Bengal (East Pakistan as well as West Bengal), the Indian prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, and the Pakistani prime minister, Liaquat Ali Khan, signed an agreement on April 8, 1950. The agreement, known as the Delhi Pact on Minorities or Nehru- Liaquat Pact, envisaged the appointment of ministers from minority communities in both Pakistan and India at both central and provincia

ause the two governments failed to restore confidence among the refugees. Further, the properties of the refugees were declared as enemy property. [India brought amendments in the Enemy Property Act, 1968 in 2016 also.] The provisions of the Nehru-Liaquat Pact were severely criticised by Hindu nationalists like Syama Prasad Mukherjee (also spelt Shyama Prasad Mookerjee) and K.C. Neogy. Mukherjee resig

h). The government settled some refugees in the Andaman Islands too (at present, Bengalis form the largest linguistic group in some parts of Andaman Islands). Communists and Independence On September 1948, on the pretext of maintaining law and order situation in South India, the Indian army intervened and  

rabad became complicated due to the Telangana movement led by the communists. The alliance between the Congress and the communists had broken before the accession of Hyderabad into India. In December 1947, the Communist Party of India (CPI) had denounced the Indian independence as ‘fake’—with the slogan, ‘ye azadi jhooti hai’—and termed the Congress government led by Nehru as the stooges of Anglo-Amer

ican imperialism and the feudal forces within the country. In February–March 1948, in its Second Congress in Calcutta, the CPI adopted its ‘Political Thesis’, which formally declared that the national government established on August 15, 1947 was indeed the major enemy of the Indi

y the Congress, alleged as collaborationist bourgeoisie, was necessary to shift the attention of the masses from the politics of communal hatred that shrouded the country after partition. 2. The late 1940s and the early 1950s witnessed communist successes in Asian countries like China, Malaya, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Burma (Myanmar). In September 1947, Russia announced its ‘A. Zhdanov thesis’ 

 after Independence. The government also decided to take stern action; while in the Hyderabad region, the Indian armed forces continued its ‘police action’, in West Bengal the CPI was banned in March 1948 and in January, a security act was passed to imprison the communist leaders without trial. Within the Communist leadership, there were divisions on the ‘Chinese line’ and the ‘Russian line’ which bec

ame wider after the failure of a proposed railway strike on May 9, 1949. In September 1950, the prominent communist leaders like Ajoy Ghosh, S.A. Dange, and S.V. Ghate criticised the organisation for its faulty strategies and its failure to take notice of the true picture of independent In

dia. Consequently, in October 1951, at the Third Party Congress of the CPI, held in Calcutta, a significant shift in its policy was endorsed. It decided to withdraw the Telangana Movement and forge an inclusive front of the peasants, 

workers, and middle classes. Consequently, the ban was lifted by the government, and the Indian communists participated in the general election of 1951–52, thus moving from an insurrectionist path to the path of constitutional democracy.  

 in India. The evolution of relations between the British authority and states can be traced under the following broad stages. I. The Company’s Struggle for Equality from a Position of Subordination (1740–1765) Starting with Anglo-French rivalry with the coming of Dupleix in 1751, the East India Company asserted political identity with the capture of Arcot (1751). With the Battle of Plassey in 1757, t

 power next only to the Bengal nawabs. In 1765, with the acquisition of the Diwani of Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa, the East India Company became a significant political power. II. Policy of Ring Fence (1765–1813) This policy was reflected in Warren Hastings’ wars against the Marathas and Mysore, and aimed at creating buffer zones to defend the Company’s frontiers. The main threat was from the Marathas a

ce on British Government in India. Major powers such as Hyderabad, Awadh, and the Marathas accepted subsidiary alliance. Thus, British supremacy was established. III. Policy of Subordinate Isolation (1813–1857) Now, the imperial idea grew and the theory of paramountcy began to develop—Indian states were supposed to act in subordinate cooperation with the British government and acknowledge its supremac

ty but retained sovereignty in internal administration. British Residents were transformed from diplomatic agents of a foreign power to executive and controlling officers of a superior government. In 1833, the Charter Act ended the Company’s commercial functions even as it retained political functions. It adopted the practice of insisting on prior approval/sanction for all matters of succession. In 18

 IV. Policy of Subordinate Union (1857–1935) The year 1858 saw the assumption of direct responsibility by the Crown. Because of the states’ loyalty during the 1857 revolt and their potential use as breakwaters in political storms of the future, the policy of annexation was abandoned. The new policy was to punish or depose but not to annex. After 1858, the ficti

public opinion. The Government of India exercised complete and undisputed control in international affairs—it could declare war, peace, or neutrality for states. According to the Butler Commission in 1927, “For the purpose of international relations, state territory is in the same position as British territory and state subjects in the same position as British subjects.” Curzon’s Approach Curzon stret

rmed to a single line. The new trend seemed to reduce all states to a single type—uniformly dependent on the British government and considered as an integral part of the Indian political system. Post-1905 A policy of cordial cooperation began to counter progressive and revolutionary developments in the face of large-scale political unrests. According to the recommendations of the Montford Reforms (192

2. Represented through representatives—127 3. Recognised as feudal holdings or jagirs Butler Committee The question of extent of sovereignty and paramountcy was still undefined. The Butler Committee (1927) was set up to examine the nature of relationship between the princely states and the government. It gave the following recommendations: 1. Paramountcy must remain supreme and must fulfil its obligat

 V. Policy of Equal Federation (1935–1947): A Non-Starter The Government of India Act, 1935 proposed a Federal Assembly with 125 out of 375 seats for the princes and the Council of States with 104 out of 160 seats for the princes, under its scheme of an all-India federation, which was subje

esenting more than half of the population and entitled to more than half of the seats in the Council of States. This scheme never came into existence and after the outbreak of World War II (September 1939), it was dropped altogether. VI. Integration and Merger After World War II began and a position of non-cooperation was adopted by the Congress, the British government tried to break the deadlock thro

ugh the Cripps Mission (1942), Wavell Plan (1945), Cabinet Mission (1946), and Attlee’s Statement (February 1947). Cripps held that the British government did not contemplate transferring paramountcy of Crown to any other party in India. The states tried various schemes to forge a union of their own, envisaging

 dominion in matters of defence, communication, and external affairs—the three areas which had been part of the paramountcy of the Crown and over which the states had anyway no control. By August 15, 1947, 136 states had joined the Indian Union but others remained precariously outside.  

he repressive attitude of the nawab, there was a plebiscite which decided in favour of India. 2. Hyderabad Hyderabad wanted a sovereign status. It signed a Standstill Agreement with India in November 1947. Indian troops withdrew and the Nizam’s police and stormtroopers (Razakkars) took over. The Nizam wanted an outlet to the sea (Goa). The violence and supply of foreign arms prompted Indian troops to 

move in again in 1948— described as “a police action to restore law and order”. Hyderabad acceded in November 1949. 3. Kashmir The state of Jammu and Kashmir had a Hindu prince and a Muslim majority population. The prince envisaged a sovereign status for the state and was reluctant to accede to either of the domi

established state of Pakistan sent its forces behind a front of tribal militia and moved menacingly towards Srinagar. It was now that the prince was forced to sign an Instrument of Accession (October 1947) with the Indian Union, endorsed by the popular leader Sheikh Abdullah. Indian troops were despatched to defend the state against the raiders from Pakistan. India’s complaints to the UN Security Coun

sore accepted Indian jurisdiction in Union, concurrent subjects except taxation and subject to differences as under Article 238 and the supervisory power of Union for 10 years. The Seventh Amendment (1956) abolished Part-B states as a class and formed one class out of Parts A and B; thus special provisions relating to Part B states were deleted. The Indian states thus became part of one uniform politi

 647 CHAPTER 35 Making of the Constitution for India The Indian Constitution, which came into effect on January 26, 1950, has the distinction of being the longest in the world in terms of its length, content, the and complexity owing to the country’s size and diversity. At the time of framing of the constitution, India

sion, in another way it sought to nurture democratic institutions in what had long been a culture of hierarchy and deference. Background Although the Constitution of India was framed between December 1946 and December 1949, its roots lie deep in the Indian national movement against the colonial rule as well as in the movements for responsible and constitutional government in the princely states. Mridu

la Mukherjee, in her work, India Since Independence, has rejected the idea that the British initiated a modern, responsible, and constitutional government in India and that the 1950 Constitution was merely the culmination of the series of constitutional initiatives made by the British in 1861, 1892, 1909, 1919, and 1935. The fact that British  

 concessions, at every stage, fell far short of what nationalists were demanding for. In the modern sense, there appeared the Constitution of India Bill, also known as the Home Rule Bill in 1895, which envisaged basic human rights such as freedom of expression, equality before the law, right to the inviolability of one’s home, right to property, etc., for all citizens of India. Although, the

re is no conclusive evidence to prove the authorship of the Home Rule Bill, Annie Besant believed that the bill was inspired by Tilak. In 1922, Mahatma Gandhi, in an article titled ‘Independence’ published in Young India, wrote that Swaraj would not be a free gift of the British Parliament but a declaration of India’s full self-expression—t

inivasa Shastri made important contributions, was accepted unanimously by the executive committee of the Parliamentary Labour Party. The bill had its first reading in the House of Commons in December 1925; it was defeated, but it proved crucial as it had the support of very wide sections of Indian opinion, and it specified in clear words that “India shall be placed on an equal footing with the self-go

verning dominions”. After the Non-Cooperation Movement, Motilal Nehru in February 1924 introduced in the Central Legislative Assembly a resolution that gave due regard to minority rights and interests and came to be known as the National Demand. It was passed by a large majority in the

t time, a demand for a constitution and the procedure for its adoption were expounded in clear terms. Britain, in response to the National Demand, appointed the all-white Simon Commission in November 1927 to recommend further constitutional changes. In response to Lord Birkenhead’s challenge, the Nehru Report, submitted on August 1928, was an outline of a draft constitution for India. Most of its feat

d the provincial legislatures with reservation of seats for minorities in certain cases for a limited period. In the aftermath of the Nehru Report, the Simon Commission was boycotted, and in December 1929, the Congress declared complete independence as its ultimate goal. The idea that India’s Constitution should be framed via a Constituent Assembly elected for this very purpose and based on the widest

 possible franchise gained support. Although, M.N. Roy had made such a suggestion earlier, Jawaharlal Nehru was the first national leader to enunciate the idea in 1933. The Congress took up the demand for a constituent assembly as a part of its official policy in 1934 after refusing the Simon Commission’s recommendations of 1933 as not expressive of the will of the

ut outside interference, by a Constituent Assembly elected on the basis of adult franchise”, and, the Working Committee of the Congress reiterated the stand. At the Lucknow session of the Congress in 1936, it was declared that “no constitution imposed by an outside authority and no constitution which curtails the sovereignty of the people” would be acceptable to the Congress. In July 1937, after the C

 in the assemblies rejecting the present constitution and demanding a Constituent Assembly. In August, the CWC accepted a draft resolution prepared under Acharya Kripalani. Between August and October 1937, all the Congress-ruled provinces and Sind passed this resolution and demanded repealment of the Government of India Act, 1935. In September 1937 itself, a resolution recommending the  

 replacement of the 1935 Act by a constitution framed by a constituent assembly was introduced in the Central Legislative Assembly by S. Satyamurti. The same demand was reiterated in the Haripura session of 1938. The Cripps 

Proposals of 1942, though rejected by the Congress as unacceptable, had one redeeming feature in that it conceded the request of Indians to frame their own constitution through a constituent assembly. In September 194

5, the newly elected Labour government in England announced that it planned to create a constituent assembly in India. On March 15, 1946, the Cabinet Mission came to India and, in the course of its stay, recommended the forming of (a) the Constituent Assembly, and (b) an interim government. Constituent Assembly Formation It was decide

s from the Indian states. The states’ representatives were to be nominated by the respective rulers. Elections for the 296 seats assigned to the British Indian Provinces were completed by July–August 1946. The Congress won 208 seats including all the General seats except 9 and the Muslim League 73 seats, that is, all but 5 of the seats allotted to Muslims. The 93 seats meant for the states’ representa

ncely states decided not to participate in the Constituent Assembly. However, representatives of some of the states (Baroda, Bikaner, Jaipur, Patiala, Rewa, and Udaipur) entered the Assembly by April 1947 and by August 15, 1947 and, soon after, all the states had sent their representatives to the Assembly. The Assembly was, however, not able to start its work immediately as Jinnah withdrew his accepta

 early session of the Assembly. The party also accepted the viceroy’s invitation to form an interim government, with Jawaharlal Nehru as prime minister. The Constituent Assembly opened on December 9, 1946 in the Constitution Hall—now the Central Hall of Parliament House at New Delhi. Jawaharlal Nehru moved the historic Objectives Resolution on 13 December 1946, after it had been in session for some da

gnty belonging to the people. The resolution gave to the Assembly its guiding principles and the philosophy of constitutionmaking. Two Constituent Assemblies: India and Pakistan By the end of January 1947, it was clear that there was no possibility of the Muslim League’s joining the Assembly; an uncompromising call for a separate constituent assembly for Pakistan had been given by Jinnah. On June 26, 

1947, Lord Mountbatten, the Governor General of India, announced the setting up of a separate Constituent Assembly for Pakistan.  

 The Indian Independence Act, 1947, passed with surprising speed, came into force on July 18, 1947. The Indian Independence Act, 1947 declared the Constituent Assembly of India to be a fully sovereign body, and on the midnight of August 14–15, 1947, the Assembly assumed full powers of the governance of the country. Section 8 of the

The Constituent Assembly was indirectly elected by the provincial assemblies, which themselves were elected on the basis of a limited franchise established by the Government of India Act of 1935. The 1935 Act imposed qualifications on the basis of tax, property, and education. This kept out more than 70 per cent of the adult population from the voting. The Constituent Assembly thus reflected

After Independence With the independence of India on August 15, 1947, the Constituent Assembly became a sovereign body responsible for framing the Constitution as well as making ordinary laws. Now the work of Constituent Assembly was organised into five stages: first—

 fourth—the draft constitution was debated and amendments proposed; fifth—the Constitution of India was adopted. Work : Committees and Consensus When the Constituent Assembly first met on December 9, 1946, J.B. Kripalani, the then Congress president, proposed  

ted as the President of the Constituent Assembly. The Constituent Assembly appointed several committees for framing the Constitution. These committees submitted their reports between April and August 1947, and on the basis of these reports, Dr B.N. Rau, the Constitutional Adviser, submitted a draft of the Constitution by the end of October 1947. This draft contained 240 Clauses and 13 Schedules. In or

Khaitan on the latter’s death in 1948.) The Drafting Committee prepared the first draft of the Constitution. This was then circulated for the comments of jurists, lawyers, judges, and other publicmen. In the light of their comments and c

riticism, the Drafting Committee prepared a second draft which consisted of 315 Articles and 9 Schedules. This second draft was placed before the Constituent Assembly on February 21, 1948. The draft was then considered clause by clause by the Assembly. The third reading commenced on November 14 and was finished on November 26, 1949. The Preamble was adopted last. It had taken 2 years,

rly 2,500 were actually discussed before the Draft Constitution was accepted. Dr Ambedkar then moved a motion that the Constitution, as settled by the Constituent Assembly, be passed. On November 26, 1949, the people of India in the Constituent Assembly adopted, enacted, and gave to themselves the Constitution of the Sovereign Democratic Republic of India. Dr Rajendra Prasad, as president of the assem

Ambedkar their signatures to it on January 24, 1950—the last day of the Assembly. In all, 284 members actually signed the Constitution. The Constituent Assembly, besides drafting the Constitution of India, adopted the National Flag on July 22, 1947, a

nd adopted the National Anthem and National Song on January 24, 1950—the last day of its session. The Constituent Assembly elected Dr Rajendra Prasad as the first President of India on January 24, 1950. Late in the evening of August 14, 1947, the Assembly met in the Constitution Hall, and at the stroke of midnight, took over as the Legislative Assembly of an Independent India. The Assembly continue

d as the provisional Parliament of India from January 26, 1950 till the new Parliament was installed after the first general elections. It must, however, be noted that while the formal centres of the work of drafting the Constitution were, no doubt, the Constitu

tions and a signatory to 600 odd treaties. India had signed the Versailles Treaty after the First World War, largely as a result of having contributed more than a million soldiers to that war. In the 1920s, it was a founding member of the League of Nations, the International Labour Organisation, and the International Court of Justice. It participated in the Washington Conference on Naval Armaments in 

1921–22. From 1920, there was an Indian high commissioner in London. Even before the First World War, Indian nationals were staffing a few diplomatic posts. It was no accident that Indians formed the largest and most i

nfluential non-Western contingent in the United Nations and allied agencies very soon after independence. The basic framework of India’s foreign policy was structured much before 1947. A significant and inevitable fallout of the Western influence on the nationalist intelligentsia was a growing interest in and contact with the dominant international currents and events. Gradually, 

stallisation of an anti-imperialist nationalist ideology, there emerged a nationalist foreign policy perspective. The evolution of this policy perspective can be traced under these broad phases. From 1880 to First World War: Anti-imperialism and Pan-Asian Feeling After 1878, the British undertook a number of expansionist expeditions which were opposed by the nationalists. These expeditions included: ●

 the Second Afghan War (1878–80); ● the dispatch of troops by England in 1882, to suppress the nationalist uprising by Colonel Arabi in Egypt; ● annexation of Burma in 1885; ● invasion of Tibet under Curzon in 1903; and ● a number of annexations during the 1890s in the north-west to stop the Russian advance. The nationalists supported the tribal resistance to these adve

ntures by the British. In place of an aggressive imperialism, the nationalists advocated a policy of peace. C. Sankaran Nair, the Congress president in 1897, said, “Our true policy is a peaceful policy.” So, the emerging themes during 1880–1914 were: 1. Solidarity with other colonies fighting for freedom, such as Russia, Ireland, Egypt, Turkey, Ethiopia,

 Sudan, Burma, and Afghanistan; 2. Pan-Asian feeling reflected in: ● condemnation of annexation of Burma in 1885; ● inspiration from Japan as an example of industrial development; ● condemnation of the participation of Japan in the international suppression of the I-Ho-Tuan uprising (1895); ● condemnation of th

itain would apply the same principles of democracy for which they were supposed to be fighting. After the conclusion of the War, the Congress insisted on being represented at the Peace Conference. In 1920, the Congress urged the people not to join the army to fight in the West. In 1925, the Congress condemned the dispatch of Indian Army to suppress the Chinese nationalist army under Sun- Yat-Sen. 1920

s and 1930s—Identifying with Socialists In 1926 and 1927, Nehru was in Europe where he came in contact with the socialists and other leftist leaders. Earlier, Dadabhai Naoroji attended the Hague session of the International Socialist Congress. He was a clo

se friend of H.M. Hyndman, the famous socialist. Lajpat Rai also made contacts with the American socialists during his visit to the USA from 1914 to 1918. Gandhi had close relations with Tolstoy and Rolland Romain. In 1927, Nehru attended the Congress of Oppressed Nationalists at Brussels on behalf of the Indian National Congress. The conference was o

ience. Nehru was also nominated to the executive council of the League Against Imperialism. The Congress also decided to open a foreign department to be in touch with the other peoples’ movements. In 1927, Nehru also visited the Soviet  

 Union and was very impressed by the achievements of the infant socialist state. He saw Russia as a bulwark against imperialism. After 1936—Anti-Fascism The 1930s saw the rise of Fascism in Europe and the struggle against it. The nationalists saw imperialism and fascism as organs of capitalism. They lend support to the struggle against fascism in other parts 

of the world in Ethiopia, Spain, China, and Czechoslovakia. In 1939, at the Tripuri session, the Congress dissociated itself from the British policy which supported fascism in Europe. In 1939, the Japanese attack on China was condemned by the nationalists. The Congress also sent a medical mission under Dr Atal to China. On the Palestine issue, the Congress lent support to the Palestinians

he also understood the importance of maintaining an identity as a free nation and not become a satellite of any other nation, however mighty. In his address to the Constituent Assembly on December 4, 1947, Nehru laid the foundations of India’s foreign policy: “....the art of conducting the foreign affairs of a country lies in finding out what is most advantageous to the country. We may talk about peac

the circumstances, non-alignment seemed to be the right policy. Panchsheel and Non-Alignment Panchsheel and Non-Alignment are the foundations of India’s foreign policy. Panchsheel It was on April 29, 1954, that Panchsheel, or the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, were first formally enunciated in the Agreement on Trade and Intercourse between the Tibet region of China and India. It was stated 

, (i) Mutual respect for each other’s territorial integrity and sovereignty (ii) Mutual non-aggression (iii) Mutual non-interference (iv) Equality and mutual benefit (v) Peaceful co-existence In June 1954, when the Chinese premier, Zhou Enlai visited India, he and his Indian counterpart, Jawaharlal Nehru in a joint statement elaborated their vision of Panchsheel as the framework for the relations betw

’. Most Indians think ‘Panchsheel’ was Jawaharlal Nehru’s valuable contribution to the world, as it first received world attention when he and Zhou Enlai issued a joint statement in Delhi on June 18, 1954. In fact, the credit for formulating these principles should go to Zhou. While receiving the Indian delegation to the Tibetan trade talks on December 31, 1953, he enunciated them as “five principles 

ce of these principles to Nehru, with whom he enjoyed a close rapport. Nehru agreed and Kaul took the initiative to mention them at the very outset of his draft text of agreement. That was in January 1954. However, the response from the Chinese foreign office was in the negative. At the time Zhou wasn’t in China. When Zhou returned to Peking, he, with his native genius for compromise, found a via-medi

y, but could appear in the preamble. India accepted the compromise. But two months later, when Zhou visited Delhi, Nehru and Kaul emphasised these principles in the joint statement issued on June 18, 1954. China’s hesitant formulation caught worldwide attention because of Indian sponsorship. Zhou propounded the principles, but Kaul picked them up and Nehru propagated them. Nehru enjoyed high regard in

 self-seeking or vindictive colleagues and they died disenchanted men. Source: An article by V.V. Paranjpe, formerly Chinese language expert to the Government of India, in The Hindustan Times of June 2004.  

As per the documents of the Ministry of External Affairs, Panchsheel was incorporated into the Ten Principles of International Peace and Cooperation put forward in the Declaration issued by the April 1955 Bandung Conference of 29 Afro-Asian countries. The universal relevance of Panchsheel was emphasised when its tenets were incorporated in a resolution on peaceful co-existence presented by India, Yugo

slavia, and Sweden, and unanimously adopted on December 11, 1957, by the United Nations General Assembly. And in 1961, the Conference of Non-Aligned Nations in Belgrade accepted Panchsheel as the basic principles at the centre of the Non-Aligned Movement. Non-Alignment The global environment that India faced after i

g recognition as a powerful state for crushing the German might on the Eastern Front where most of the German military casualties had occurred. If the US demonstrated its nuclear weapon capability in 1945, the USSR followed suit with its own nuclear test in 1949. The Cold War that began in the wake of the Second World War had no precedent in history. Almost the entire developed world was divided into 

wer competition. Meanwhile, decolonisation was proceeding apace, and more and more independent countries were emerging, mostly in Asia and Africa. China was aligned with the Soviet Union till the mid-1950s. India found itself the largest country with the ability to manoeuvre between the two blocs.  

gnty (which are the basic postulates of India’s foreign policy) evolved into the crystallisation of the concept of non-alignment. The term ‘non-alignment’ got currency in the post-Bandung Conference (1955). Non-alignment implies Five Criteria of Non-alignment The Preparatory Committee of the first non-aligned conference laid down the following five criteria of non-alignment: (i) A country should follo

ive refusal of a state to align itself with either party in a dispute between two power blocs. In the conference of non-aligned powers—the first non-aligned movement or NAM summit—held in Belgrade in 1961 and attended by 36 Mediterranean and Afro-Asian powers, Jawaharlal Nehru explained the essence of non-alignment: “We call ourselves the conference of non-aligned countries. Now the word nonaligned ma

 665 CHAPTER 37 First General Elections With the Constitution coming into force in 1950, India no longer had a dominion status and could sever any remaining links with Britain; it was a sovereign democratic republic. The provisions of the Constitution relating to citizenship and Article

 324 (the Election Commission) were brought into force on November 26, 1949, while the rest of the Constitution came into force on January 26, 1950. The next year, the government wanted to go in for general elections to constitute the House of the People—the Lok Sabha—as provided for in the Constitution. The founding fathers of the Indian Consti

ure in the Constitution itself (Part XV, Articles 324 to 329). Groundwork for the Elections The Election Commission The office of the Election Commission had been set up in a small way on January 25, 1950. The first Chief Election Commissioner of India was Sukumar Sen, an ICS officer, who assumed office on March 21, 1950. Although the Constitution provides for the appointment of other members of the E

ion for Polls Two major measures were passed by Parliament which provided the detailed law under which elections were to be held. The first of these measures was the Representation of the People Act, 1950, which provided for the qualifications of voters and matters connected with the preparation and publication of electoral rolls. It also allocated the number of seats in the House of the People to the

 several states and fixed the number of seats in each state legislature. The second legislation was the Representation of the People Act, 1951, which laid down other provisions relating to qualifications and disqualifications of members, the conduct of elections, poll expenses, the poll itself, counting of votes, etc. It was only after thes

e laws were passed that the electoral machinery could be put in place. So, though the government was in a hurry to hold the elections as early as 1950 and then by the spring of 1951, the first phase of the elections could be held only from October 15, 1951. Of the 489 seats in the House of the People to be filled by election, 72 seats were reserved for candidates belonging to th

 (roughly more than 173 million). Of these, approximately 45 per cent were women voters. The total population of India (excluding Jammu and Kashmir) according to the 1951 census was 35,66,91,760. As much as 49 per cent of the total population was thus enrolled as voters. Challenges Most of the voters were poor, illiterate, and came from rural areas, and had no experie

dia were also beginning to take shape. Just before the first elections, Syama Prasad Mukherjee (industries minister under Nehru) broke away to set up the Bharatiya Jana Sangh (a proto-BJP) in October 1951. Dr. B. R. Ambedkar revived the Scheduled  

ongress candidate, Manmohini Sahgal, in Delhi. After the votes were counted and results declared, the first Lok Sabha or the House of the People was constituted by the Election Commission on April 2, 1952. Until this point, the Indian Constituent Assembly had served as an interim legislature.  

 672 CHAPTER 38 Developments under Nehru's Leadership (1947–1964) Jawaharlal Nehru, as the first prime minister of independent India, along with other leaders, laid the foundation of a new India. The period between India’s independence and the death of Nehru, in M

ay 1964, has been often termed as ‘Nehruvian Era’ due to Nehru’s influence on almost all aspects of decisions taken in India during that time. Nehru was influenced by many streams of thought, some imported f

 Political Developments In the first general elections in 1952, the Congress won a huge majority and formed the government at the Centre headed by Jawaharlal Nehru. Rajendra Prasad was elected president by the electoral college of the first Parliament of India. 

Nehru led the Congress to major election victories in 1957 and 1962, though the winning majority was reduced towards the end. Parliament in this period legislated various noteworthy laws that were directed towards social change and equity. (These aspects are dealt wi

f the Constitution. Thus, by referring to Hindi as the official language rather than national, the committee hoped to placate the opposition. The language issue was further clarified by Parliament in 1963 through the Official Languages Act, which stated that Hindi was to become the official language in India from  

 1965. But as a concession to the non-Hindi speakers, English was accorded the status of ‘associate additional official language’. Despite this, among non-Hindi speakers, especially in South India, the res

entment against Hindi continued, and in late 1964 and in early 1965, violent demonstrations erupted over the language issue. The Official Languages (Amendment) Act of 1967 provided a bilingual (English- Hindi) solution for any official communication between the Centre and states, and gave a concession to the diverse multiplicity of languages by recognising regional lan

daries were drawn either for administrative convenience or simply coincided with the territories annexed by the British government or the territories ruled by the princely states. The Congress in its 1920’s session in Nagpur had made efforts to recognise regional linguistic identities and divided India into 21 linguistic units for its organisational set-up. Many provincial Congress committees were set

zones, which often did not coincide with the administrative divisions of British India. However, when demands for the linguistic reorganisation of the provinces came up in the Constituent Assembly in 1946 and after independence, the national leadership under the Congress opposed it on the ground of national unity. The situation in the newly independent country was difficult. India’s partition had crea

 serious economic and law and order problems. The Kashmir problem and a war-like situation with Pakistan needed urgent attention. However, due to continuous demands, the Constituent Assembly, in June 1948, appointed the Linguistic Provinces Commission, headed by Justice S.K. Dhar, to enquire into the need of linguistic provinces. The Dhar Commission, however, opposed such a move in the interest of nat

 integration. Consequently, the Constituent Assembly decided not to include the linguistic principle in the Constitution. In December 1948, to pacify the vocal votaries of linguistic states, the Congress appointed a committee (JVP), with Jawaharlal Nehru, Vallabhbhai Patel, and Pattabhi Sitaramayya as its members. Its report which is kn

ty. There was widespread agitation, especially in southern India, in the wake of the JVP report. The first demand for a linguistic province was seen in the Telugu-speaking region of Andhra. In August 1951, Swami Sitaram, a Congressman and Gandhian leader, started a fast unto death. While he broke his fast after 35 days, the movement was renewed in December 1952, by another Gandhian follower, Potti Sri

llowed by rioting, demonstrations, hartals, and violence all over the Andhra region. The government conceded the demand for a separate state of Andhra, which finally came into existence on October 1, 1953, with the region being separated from the Tamilspeaking Madras state. The creation of Andhra encouraged other linguistic groups to intensify their movements for their own state or for rectification o

f their boundaries on a linguistic ground. Under popular pressure, Nehru government appointed the States Reorganisation Commission (SRC) in August 1953. The commission, comprising Justice Fazl Ali, K.M. Panikkar, and Hridaynath Kunzru as members, submitted its report in October 1955; its recommendations were accepted with some modifications and impl

emented quickly. In November 1956, the States Reorganisation Act was passed which provided for 14 states and 6 centrally administered territories, but many of these states still contained sizeable linguistic minorities and regional e

larged by adding Kannada-speaking areas of adjoining states— Bombay, Madras, Hyderabad, and Coorg. As the SRC had opposed the splitting of Bombay and Punjab, a widespread rioting broke out in January 1956 in Bombay city. The government finally agreed in May 1960 to bifurcate the state of Bombay into Maharashtra and Gujarat, with Bombay city being included in Maharashtra and Ahmedabad being made the ca

pital of Gujarat. The Nagas, the first to raise the issue of ethnic identity, forced the Government of India to concede to demand for a separate state of Nagaland in 1960, inaugurated in 1963. In an exception to the linguistic principle, in 1956, the states of PEPSU were merged with Punjab. Punjab remained a trilingual state having three language speakers—Punjabi, Hindi, and Pahari. The d

Growth of Other Political Parties Through the 1950s and 1960s, the Congress party ruled at the Centre and in most of the states. The people voted for the Congress mainly because they saw it as the legatee of the freedom struggle and because its leade

Perhaps the first time people exercised their right of choice for a party other than the Congress was when they voted the Communists into power in Kerala in 1957. Then, in 1963, three notable opponents of the Congress were elected to the Lok Sabha, namely, the socialist Ram Manohar Lohia, the liberal M.R. Masani, and the Gandhian Acharya Kripalani. All this s

. The period also saw the start and growth of political parties other than the Congress and the Communist Party of India and notable changes within the communist groups. The Socialist Party Formed in 1934 as Congress Socialist Party (SP), with its own constitution, membership, discipline, and ideology, it

 remained within the Congress Party till March 1948. Their disassociation as a protest against the Congress’s move towards the right and its growing authoritarian tendencies was announced at a meeting in Nashik on March 28, 1948. In September 1952, th

e CSP merged with the Kisan Mazdoor Praja Party (KMPP) to form a new party—Praja Socialist Party (PSP). Praja Socialist Party In September 1952, the Socialist Party and the KMPP merged to form Praja Socialist Party (PSP), with J.B. Kripalani as the chairman and Ashoka Mehta as the general secretary. With the merger, it became the largest opp

osition party to the Congress with all-India presence. But the party could not maintain its cohesion for long. In June 1953, at the party’s Betul conference, Ashok Mehta called for support to the ruling party, as he believed that in a backward country like India the crucial task was economic development—a common challenge

oach. Lohia believed in a position of equidistance from both the Congress and the Communists, and supported the organisation of militant mass movements. Lohia and his group left the PSP at the end of 1955. While Acharya Narendra Dev died in 1956, Jayaprakash Narayan, in 1954, announced that he would dedicate his life to Bhoodan and other constructive activities. In 1957, after the general elections, J

ayaprakash Narayan left active politics, declaring that party politics was not suitable for India and campaigned for ‘partyless democracy’. Kripalani, in 1960, left the party too, and three years later, Ashok Mehta agreed to become the deputy chairman of the Planning Commission. Ashok Mehta joined the Congress Party with almost one-third of PSP cadres with

 him. Lohiya formed the Socialist Party, which in 1964, merged with the PSP to form the Samyukta (or United) Socialist Party (SSP). In 1965, the party split again—Lohia’s group kept the SSP label, while his critics started a fresh PSP.  

 to accept that India had become a sovereign republic but also felt its policies were pro-capitalist and anti-people. The communists would offer a ‘democratic front’ to replace the Congress Party. In 1958, at its Amritsar meeting, the party declared that it was possible to advance to socialism through peaceful and parliamentary means. And, if the party came to power, it would grant full civil libertie

s, including the right to oppose the socialist government and the socialist system through constitutional mechanisms. Then, in 1961, at Vijayawada, it was decided to follow a policy of struggle as well as unity towards Congress—progressive policies were to be supported, while struggle against other policies were to continue. Spli

Some communists supported the government fully against the Chinese invasion, while others, though opposed to the Chinese stand on the question of India- China frontiers, also opposed the unqualified

In 1964, the party got divided into, CPI—representing the earlier ‘right’ and ‘centrist’ trends, and CPM or the Communist Party (Marxist)—representing the earlier ‘left’ trend. The CPM believed that the Indi

Bharatiya Jan Sangh The Bharatiya Jan Sangh, founded on October 21, 1951, was based on right wing ideology. According to Bipan Chandra, the Jana Sangh was a communal party, and to understand its basic character and politics, the genesis of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh

(In 1965, it gave up this demand in view of expansion of party in non-Hindi belt and accepted the decision to retain English along with Hindi so long as the non-Hindi states wanted this.) Dr Syama Prasad Mukh

The Swatantra Party Founded in August 1959, the Swatantra Party was a nonsocialist, constitutionalist, and secular conservative party having distinguished leaders like C. Rajagopalachari (who resigned from the Congress), Minoo Masani, N.G. Ra

th the US and countries of Western Europe. In fact, it advocated for a defence coalition with noncommunist countries of Asia including Pakistan, under the capitalist superpower, United States. In the 1962 elections, it won 18 seats in the Lok Sabha and emerged as the main opposition party in four states (Bihar, Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Orissa). Factions, defections, and death of C. Rajagopalachari in 1

967, proved detrimental to the Swatantra Party. Most of the party leaders joined the Bharatiya Lok Dal in 1974, while a small group led by Masani tried to survive the party.

In the end, he succumbed to pressure from within and outside his party and advised the dismissal of the EMS government and imposition of President’s Rule in Kerala in July 1959. A democratically elected government was thus, for the first time in independent India, dismissed under emergency powers. Concept of Planning for Economic Development Nehru believed in effective plan

its growth and acting directly to promote the welfare of the population. Nehru, together with several national leaders, was fascinated with the success of economic planning in the Soviet Union in the 1930s and 1940s. The genesis of the Planning Commission could be traced to the National Planning Committee established in 1938 by Congress, and the Bombay Plan of 1944. The Planning Commission, an extra-c

onstitutional body, was set up in March 1950 by a simple resolution of the Government of India. The body was assigned the task of economic planning in the form of five-year plans. The prime minister, himself, was the ex-officio chairman of the 

commission. The National Development Council (NDC), which was to give final approval to the plans, was established on August 6, 1952. The First Five-Year Plan (1951–56), based on Harrod– Domar model, sought to get the nation’s economy out of the cycle of poverty. It addressed, mainly, the agrarian sector including investments in dams and irrigation. Huge allocat

Social Developments Developments in Education In 1951, only 16.6 per cent of the total population was literate and the percentage was much lower in rural areas. Between 1951 and 1961, schoo

l enrolment doubled for boys and tripled for girls. Through the personal interest and efforts of Nehru, several policies were introduced to improve the educational situation. By 1964, the number of universities increased from 18 (in 1947) to 54. In 1949, the Indian University Education Commission, under the chairmanship of Dr. S. Radhakrishnan was set up. On the recommendation of

 the commission, the University Grants Commission (UGC) was set up in 1953, and University Grants Commission Act was passed in 1956. For improvements in the secondary education, the government appointed Mudaliar Commission in 1952, with Dr. A. Lakshmanswami Mudaliar as chairperson. Further, to

 assist and advise the Central and state governments on academic matters related to school education, the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) was established in September 1961 as a literary, scientific, and charitable society. Social Change under Nehru The Constitution of India ensured that Indian social organisation underwent change, leading to the social liberation of th

e hitherto socially backward and suppressed sections of society. In 1955, the government passed the Anti-Untouchability Law, making the practice of untouchability punishable and a cognisable offence. The clauses mentioned in the Constitution regarding reservations in educ

ational institutions and government employment in favour of weaker sections of the society were implemented. For women’s equal rights in the society, the Hindu Code Bill was moved in Parliament in 1951. Despite facing sharp opposition from conservative sections of society, the bill was passed in the form of four separate acts. These acts introduced monogamy and the right of divorce to both men and 

ternational level could be seen in the time of framing of UN’s Charter. Article 11 of the Charter advocates international disarmament. India supported the formation of the Atomic Energy Commission in 1947 and sponsored the Eighteen Nations Disarmament Conference in 1962. Relations with Neighbours India and Pakistan The unnaturalness and artificiality of partition impelled Pakistan to try and establish

 its identity independent of India, of which it was till 1947 a part by geography, history, tradition, and culture. Pakistan, since its birth, has the aspiration for achieving parity with India in all fields. Thus, Pakistan started competing with India at all i

nternational fora and used all kinds of means to acquire prominence. Kashmir Issue Pakistan refused to accept Kashmir’s accession to India on October 26, 1947. In response to the Pakistan-sponsored tribal attack, India, supported by the local population under Sheikh Abdullah, undertook a swift military action. But, unfortunately, before the task of rescuin

g the territory could be accomplished, a complaint was lodged by Nehru with the Security Council in January 1948. This resulted in a ceasefire on January 1, 1949. India also agreed to hold a plebiscite

 in 1947 under international supervision, but due to changed circumstances, India finally withdrew from the offer in 1955. Although diplomatic battles for Kashmir were fought in the UNO and other international forums, no actual war took place between the two countries up to 1964. Indus River Water Dispute Equitable shar

n blamed India for any calamity created by natural factors like droughts and floods in Pakistan. So, under the guidance of the World Bank, an interim agreement on canal waters was signed on April 17, 1959. Subsequently, a comprehensive agreement between the two countries was signed on September 19, 1960 in Karachi. Unfortunately, till today, on several occasions, the Indus Water Treaty has caused disc

ntries with which independent India established diplomatic relations was the Nationalist Government of China led by Chiang Kaishek. When the Nationalist Government was overthrown by the Communists in 1949, India was once more among the first countries to recognise the new government led by Mao Tse Tung. India consistently supported the efforts of the People’s Republic of China to get admitted to the U

nited Nations. But the results of all these efforts proved frustrating for India. Developments in Tibet and Panchsheel The Chinese army entered Tibet in 1950 and occupied it. India, apart from sharing about 2000 miles of frontier in the Tibet region, had inherited several rights and obligations over Tibet from the British rule. However, to maintain peace,

 Nehru in 1954 concluded an agreement with China, which formalised the Chinese occupation of Tibet. The agreement is popularly known as Panchsheel.  

 In 1959, a popular uprising took place in Tibet against Chinese dominance. Though the upsurge was suppressed by China, the religious head of Tibet, Dalai Lama fled and took asylum in India. Taking this as an

 excuse, China in 1959 occupied Longju and 12,000 square miles of Indian territory in Ladakh. This followed a series of protest notes, memorandums, and aide memoires being exchanged between the two countries. In the next m

ove, China laid claims on large parts of Indian territories, after which the Chinese prime minister, Chou-En-Lai came to New Delhi in April 1960 to negotiate border disputes. Official teams of the two countries also visited each other, but no agreement could be reached and the border dispute continued. Sino-Indian War, 1962 In October 1962, C

ntage as well as superior arms. Nehru turned to the USA and Britain for help. The Western powers—the USA as well as Britain—pledged support to India and were already flying arms to India. In November 1962, China made a unilateral declaration of its withdrawal. But China continued its occupation of a large chunk of Ladakh—a much coveted strategic link between Sin Kiang and southern China. India’s diplo

e territories yielded no results. Even the Afro-Asian mediation by Indonesia, Cambodia, Burma, UAR, Ghana, and Ceylon to find a peaceful solution of Sino-Indian border dispute, at Colombo in December 1962, failed to get a favourable response from China. In 1964, China tested its first nuclear explosion, further alarming India. Consequences of Sino-Indian War (i) The war gave a big blow to the self-res

loped links in the name of countering the Chinese threat and even planted a nuclear-powered device in the Himalayas. (vi) Pakistan, encouraged by the Indian debacle in the war, was to attack India in 1965, covertly helped by China. India and Nepal The geographical location of Nepal has made it inseparable from India from the point of view of India’s external security. Being conscious of this factor, I

ndia signed a treaty with Nepal in July 1950 by which it recognised Nepal’s sovereignty, territorial integrity, and independence. The two countries made a commitment to each other to inform each other of any serious friction or misunderstanding

 arising on any problem. India and Bhutan In August 1949, the two countries signed a treaty for perpetual peace and friendship. India undertook to exercise non-interference in the internal administration of Bhutan, while Bhutan agreed to be guided by the a

dvice of the Government of India in regard to its external relations. India and Sri Lanka The Tamil-Sinhalese riots of 1958 and thereafter attracted the sympathy of some Indian leaders for the Tamilian population of Sri Lanka. This open sympathy, inside and outside Indian Parliament, was disliked by the Sri Lankan governm

 690 CHAPTER 39 After Nehru. . . Towards the last years of Nehru’s prime ministership itself, there were serious debates on what would happen to India after him. And when he died in May 1964, many in India and abroad were almost sure that the Indian political system would be severely and adversely affected, and could even collapse, with a fight within the Congress party over who would ta

l Nanda was appointed as the interim prime minister, pending the election of a new parliamentary leader of the Congress party who would then become prime minister. The Lal Bahadur Shastri Years (June 1964 – January 1966) It is generally accepted that a group within the Congress, formed in 1963, which came to be known as the Syndicate and included the president of the party, K. Kamaraj, and some  

s Desai. In the end, Shastri was chosen by the party as the next parliamentary leader, hence the prime minister, as Desai decided not to contest. Early Life Lal Bahadur Shastri was born on October 2, 1904, in Uttar Pradesh (known as United Provinces at the time). Firmly opposed to the caste system, he decided to leave out his surname of Srivastava. ‘Shastri’ was a title he got on completing his gradua

tion at Kashi Vidyapeeth, Varanasi, in 1928. When he married Lalita Devi in 1928, Lal Bahadur Shastri, very much opposed to the idea of dowry, is said to have accepted just five yards of khadi and a spinning wheel on the insistence of his father-in-law to accept something. Swayed

 by Mahatma Gandhi, Lal Bahadur Shastri joined the freedom movement; in the Non-cooperation Movement of 1921, he was arrested for taking part in a demonstration but, as he was then a minor, he was let off. Later he was part of the major movements of the struggle against the British rule, such as the Salt Sa

tayagraha and the individual satyagraha movement, and then in the 1942 Quit India Movement. Imprisoned several times, he made use of his time in prison reading the works of the social reformers and western philosophers. Shastri was very much part of the Congress politic

 organisation, becoming the secretary of the local unit of the party and later the president of the Allahabad Congress Committee. He was elected to the Legislative Assembly of the United Provinces in 1937. Political Journey after Independence After independence, Shastri became a minister in Uttar Pradesh state, in charge of the Police and Transport portfolio  

to the police that water jets be used instead of lathis to disperse unruly mobs. Shastri was made the General Secretary of the All-India Congress Committee, with Jawaharlal Nehru as the President, in 1951. The same year he was nominated to the Rajya Sabha. Nehru drew him into the union cabinet. Shastri was the railways minister, though he resigned in 1956, taking moral responsibility for a serious rai

l accident. But he was soon drawn back into the cabinet, and in 1961, he was appointed home minister; in this capacity he achieved a reputation of being a skilful mediator, and he also formed the Committee on Prevention of Corruption headed by K. Santhanam—on the basi

y; and, during Nehru’s illness, Minister without Portfolio. Prime Minister: Continuing Nehru’s Legacy but with Change Lal Bahadur Shastri was sworn in as the second prime minister of India on June 9, 1964. He kept with himself the portfolios of external affairs and atomic energy, though he later transferred the external affairs ministry to Swaran Singh. In his first broadcast to the nation as prime mi

t faced were the violent anti-Hindi demonstrations in the state of Madras (later to be named Tamil Nadu), the widespread food shortages, and the second war with Pakistan. The country was disturbed in 1965 by major protests in the non-Hindi speaking states against the possibility of Hindi being imposed as the only national language of India. The agitation was especially intense and violent in Madras st

nning Commission to the ministries dealing with economic subjects. Indeed, there was an attempt to reduce the dominance of the Planning Commission by the setting up of a national planning council. In 1965, Shastri announced in Parliament that there would be a reconsideration of government controls over the economic activities; consequently, there was a relaxation in regulations for some sectors, such 

am in Mexico and how India must launch field demonstrations. In the face of opposition from various quarters, including the Congress party, Shastri approved the import of 250 tonnes of wheat seeds in 1965. Later, in 1966, some many thousands of tonnes were to be imported. And the Green Revolution in wheat was set in motion, as Indian scientists improved upon these varieties. In November 1965, when C.S

ure secretary, met in Rome, they signed an accord that put on paper what had already been launched with the support of Shastri. As per the accord, India was committed to end imports of food grains by 1971 by investing more in agriculture, irrigation, research, seeds, fertilisers, and put in place suitable economic and marketing policies. The Americans, for their part, agreed to send more wheat to Indi

a in 1965 and 1966. Incentives to support the new technology were also put in place. The Agricultural Prices Commission (APC) and the Food Corporation of India (FCI) came into being in January 1965. The National Seeds Corporation and the Central Warehousing Corporation were also set up around this time.  

 Shastri was also instrumental in setting in motion the White Revolution – a national campaign to raise the production and supply of milk. On his visit to Anand in Gujarat in October 1964 to inaugurate the Cattle Feed Factory of Amul at Kanjari, he was impressed by the milk cooperative. He wished that Verghese Kurien, who was the General Manager of Kaira District Co-operative Milk Pro

help in creating such cooperatives in other parts of the country so as to improve the conditions of farmers. The National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) was established, as a consequence, at Anand in 1965. Skip a Meal Idea The chronic food shortage in the country was a worrying fact. Also, during the 1965 war with Pakistan, Lyndon B. Johnson, the then President of the US, tried to put pressure on Indi

ings. New Institutions and Projects Several new institutions were inaugurated during Shastri’s tenure. Some of these were the Central Institute of Technology Campus at Tharamani, Chennai, in November 1964; the Andhra Pradesh Agricultural University at Hyderabad in March 1965 (renamed Acharya N.G. Ranga Agricultural University in 1996, and separated into two universities after the formation of the Tela

ngana State, with the university in Telangana being named in July 2014 as Professor Jayashankar Agricultural University); and the National Institute of Technology, Allahabad. The Jawahar Dock of the Chennai Port Trust was  

 inaugurated by Shastri, and the construction work of Tuticorin Port was begun in November 1964. The foundation stone for the Upper Krishna Project, of which the Alamatti Dam is a part, was laid by Shastri in 1964. (It was decided by the government to name the Almatti Dam after Lal Bahadur Shas

tri.) It was Shastri who inaugurated the plutonium reprocessing plant at Trombay in 1965. This followed the suggestion by Dr. Homi Bhabha that India should develop nuclear explosives for peaceful purposes, an idea which Shastri endorsed. At the initiative of Homi Bhabha, the nuclear expl

for Peaceful Purposes (SNEPP) was set up. Foreign Relations Shastri made no basic changes in the policy of non-alignment. However, he was deeply conscious that, in the wake of India’s war with China (1962) and the growth of military ties between Pakistan and the People’s Republic of China, the Indian government should increase the defence budget of the country. So, he tried to modernise the armed forc

es of India. He also decided that India should build closer ties with the Soviet Union. He made overtures to neighbouring states to solve outstanding problems. The Bandarnaike-Shastri accord of 1964 between India and Ceylon (as Sri Lanka was then called) was signed by Lal Bahadur Shastri and his Ceylonese counterpart, Sirimavo Bandaranaike. Concerned with the status of Indian Tamils in Ceylon, t

he pact settled for the repatriation of 6,00,000 Indian Tamils to India and Ceylonese citizenship to be granted to 3,75,000 Tamils in Ceylon—to be accomplished by 1981. Shastri, however, died soon after, and the accord was not fulfilled, and some years later India considered the agreement to have lapsed. Burma had undergone a military coup in 1962, and following th

at, many Indian families settled there had been repatriated by the Burmese government in 1964. Relations between India and Burma were strained. However, Shastri made an official visit to Rangoon in December 1965, and cordial relations were again established between India and the Burmese gover

 Considering the situation in the subcontinent and the disturbed relations with Pakistan and China, Lal Bahadur Shastri did not hesitate to initiate a nuclear explosives programme. In 1965, he gave authorisation to the Atomic Energy Commission to work on achieving a nuclear test. He faced strong opposition on this issue from his own government and party as well as others, but he did no

t waver. Unfortunately, Lal Bahadur Shastri died in January 1966 as did the prominent personality on the nuclear science programme in India, Homi J. Bhabha, before the programme could proceed. The Indo-Pak War In 1965, India faced threats of war from Pakistan. Gen

eral Mohammad Ayub Khan had come to power in Pakistan through a military coup in 1958, forcibly taking over from President Iskander Mirza and assuming the president’s post himself. The US was giving Pakistan a great deal of military support. The war with China in 1962 had left the Ind

ians, including the armed forces, feeling demoralised. So, Ayub Khan probably thought it was the right time to test the strength of the Indian forces at the frontier. In April 1965, Pakistan tested the situation in Sindh. It seemed as if the Pakistanis could win after the first clashes in the Rann of Kachchh. Both sides were, at Britain’s intervention, made to agree to a ceasef

ter independence. The United Nations intervened and a ceasefire was brokered to which both sides agreed on September 23. Peace Agreement at Tashkent A South Asian peace conference was held in January 1966 at Tashkent (the capital of Uzbekistan, then one of the republics of the Soviet Union), which was sponsored by the Soviet President, Alexei Kosygin. It was with the mediation of Kosygin that Presiden

t Ayub Khan of Pakistan and Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri of India met and signed the Tashkent Declaration on January 10, 1966 to “restore normal and peaceful relations between their countries and to promote understanding and friendly relations between their peoples”. The Tashkent Declaration was meant to form a framework fo

is background that Jammu and Kashmir was discussed, and each of the sides set forth its respective position. 2. All armed personnel of the two countries shall be withdrawn not later than 25 February, 1966 to the positions they held prior to 5 August, 1965, and both sides shall observe the ceasefire terms on the ceasefire line. 3. Relations between India and Pakistan shall be based on the principle of 

oner of Pakistan to India will return to their posts and that the normal functioning of diplomatic missions of both countries will be restored. Both governments shall observe the Vienna Convention of 1961 on Diplomatic Intercourse. 6. Measures will be considered towards the restoration of economic and trade relations, communications, as well as cultural exchanges between India and Pakistan, and to tak

 Shastri’s Death Early in the morning of January 11, 1966, the morning following the signing of the Tashkent Declaration, Lal Bahadur Shastri died of a heart attack. There was a controversy over the death, with rumours floating that Shastri had been poisone

alance of power in South Asia. The controversy has still not ended, especially as RTIs asking for relevant information have been turned down by the government. Indira Gandhi: the First Phase (January 1966 – March 1977) After the sudden and unexpected death of Lal Bahadur Shastri in January 1966, once again, Gulzarilal Nanda was appointed the interim prime minister pending elections. Morarji Desai was 

st of the senior Congressmen supported her as they thought she was weak enough to be manipulated as they wanted. Time was to prove them wrong. Early Life Indira Priyadarshini was born on November 19, 1917 in Allahabad to Jawaharlal Nehru and Kamala Nehru. India was in the midst of a struggle for freedom from the British, and the Nehru family was fully involved in the struggle. So, by either side in co

st for brief periods: these included the Ecole de Bex in Switzerland, Rabindranath Tagore’s Visva-Bharati, the university at Santiniketan, Bengal, and Somerville College, Oxford, UK, among others. In 1936, Indira joined the Indian National Congress, and in 1938, she became a member of the India League. It was during her stay in England that she met Feroze Jehangir Ghandy (later changed to Gandhi), who

 was also a member of the India League and studying in London. Feroze was a Parsi. Indira returned to India in 1941 with Feroze Gandhi, and she married him in 1942. Feroze too was a member of the Indian National Congress and took part in the freedom struggle. Indira was an active participant in the Quit India Movement and was imprisoned in Naini Central Jail fo

dence, when the Congress party came to power and Jawaharlal Nehru became the country’s prime minister, Indira often acted as her father’s hostess for events and accompanied him on his travels. In the 1951–52 General Elections, Indira Gandhi handled the campaigns of Feroze, who was contesting from Rae Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh. Feroze was elected to the Lok Sabha. But they had differences in personal l

 insurance companies and the finance minister in Nehru’s cabinet, T.T. Krishnamachari. He died in September 1960. Indira joined the Congress party’s working committee in 1955, and in 1959, she was elected the party’s president. Following the death of her father in 1964, she became a member of the Rajya Sabha and was inducted into the cabinet by Lal Bahadur Shastri as the information a

nd broadcasting minister. Prime Minister On January 19, 1966, Indira Gandhi became the third prime minister of India—the first woman to occupy the post in the country. The General Elections of 1967 came amidst economic problems—stagnation and food crisis, rising prices, unemployment—which caused much disenchantment among the people. The decision on devaluation of the rupee was criticised by man

y. Also, political disputes obstructed the import of wheat from the US. In the 1967 General Elections, Indira Gandhi won the Lok Sabha seat from Rae Bareilly. The Congress party managed to win the elections but managed only a thin majority in the Lok Sabha. Indira Gandhi was now pri

without consulting her finance minister was not approved by the senior party members. In the end, Morarji Desai was forced to resign from the cabinet. With the death of President Zakir Hussain in May 1969, things came to a head; there were strong differences over the choice of candidates for the election to the post of President of India. The official Congress candidate was Neelam Sanjiva Reddy, a mem

a Reddy to get her out of power, was in favour of V.V. Giri (erstwhile vice-president now standing as an independent candidate). V.V. Giri won the election and became the President of India in August 1969. Consequently, in November, the Congress party president, S. Nijalingappa, expelled Indira Gandhi from the party on ground of indiscipline. India Gandhi managed to win over a majority of the party me

mbers to her side and created her own faction, the Congress (R) where R stood for ‘Requisitionists’, in 1969, while the other group was the Congress (O) with O for ‘Organisation’ headed by Ram Subhag Singh. Indira Gandhi no longer had a majority in the Lok Sabha, but with the issue-based support of regional

 parties such as the DMK, the Akali Dal, and the two communist parties, she retained power at the Centre. The 1971 Elections: Indira Triumphant Indira Gandhi found she could not take independent action as head of a minority government. Her efforts at progressive  

utional amendment fell through just by one vote in the Rajya Sabha), but the presidential order derecognising the princes that Indira Gandhi brought in was nullified by the Supreme Court. In December 1970, Indira Gandhi recommended dissolution of the Lok Sabha and called for early elections. The nation thus went to the polls in 1971. The catchy slogan of the Congress (R) was ‘Garibi Hatao’ (Remove Pov

ational issues rather than fall prey to political patronage. Indira Gandhi was now well on her way to dominating the political scene for a long time to come. India’s victory over Pakistan in December 1971 and the subsequent creation of independent Bangladesh out of the erstwhile East Pakistan in the liberation war gave a big boost to the image of Indira Gandhi. In the state assembly elections in March

 1972, the Congress (R) came to power in many states. The elections of 1971 and 1972 had virtually reduced the importance of the Congress (O) and the Swatantra Party as significant opponents. Problems The huge enthusiasm for Indira Gandhi, however, started fading by 1973, in spite of

important achievements of the government. Economic problems grew. The main issue was high inflation that followed from the wartime expenses, drought in some parts of the country and the oil crisis of 1973. Food grains production declined due to poor monsoons, and low agricultural growth had its adverse impact on industry  

, India was affected by high costs of import and the resulting high prices of petroleum products. Unemployment grew. There were strikes, the most notable one being the all-India railway strike in May 1974. Most the influential social classes got gradually alienated from Indira Gandhi—the rich peasants resented land reforms, the industrialists resented the wide-scale nationalisation and socialistic pol

. The JP Movement There were protest movements in many places, especially in Gujarat and Bihar, against the rising prices of essential commodities. The Nav-Nirman Movement in Gujarat between December 1973 and March 1974 was serious enough for the central government to decide to dissolve the assembly in the state. The chief minister, Chimanbhai Patel, had to resign, and the Centre promulgated president

 1974. Indira Gandhi challenged Jayaprakash Narayan to test the strength of his group against the Congress in the 1976 elections and JP accepted the challenge. However, before the ‘contest’ could be settled democratically, things changed drastically. The Allahabad High Court Decision and the Imposition of Emergency O

n June 12, 1975, Justice Sinha of the Allahabad High Court delivered a verdict in an election petition filed by Raj Narain, Indira Gandhi’s opponent in the Rae Bareilly contest in 1971. Raj Narain had accused Indira Gandhi of corrupt practices during her election campaign. The court verdict declared Indira Gandhi’s election to the Lok Sabha in 1971 invalid on grounds of electoral m

ecause of the lawlessness. The president, accordingly, declared a State of Emergency due to internal disorder, in accordance with the provisions of Article 352(1) of the Constitution, on June 25– 26, 1975. (The prime minister’s decision had not yet been endorsed by the cabinet, and the cabinet could agree to it only after the event.) State of Emergency (1975–77) “The President has proclaimed the Emerg

andhi as the prime minister. JP seems to have forgotten the Gandhian principles on which he had been nurtured. He could have had the patience to wait for the general elections which were due in March 1976: if people were dissatisfied, they would have thrown out Indira Gandhi and the Congress. But JP and his allies were not even willing to abide by the Supreme Court judgement and wait for the final dec

ision. In her broadcast to the nation on the evening of June 26, 1975, Indira Gandhi said: “In the name of democracy it has been sought to negate the very functioning of democracy, duly elected governments have not been allowed to function… agitations have surcharged t

Parliament was practically ineffective as there was no effective opposition to debate issues. Several decrees, laws, and even constitutional amendments were passed to reduce the power of the judicia

eople believed that the Emergency was a temporary step to bring the country back on the path of progress. Even if the Congress party president Dev Kant Baruah’s sycophantic praise of Indira Gandhi in 1976 that “India is Indira, and Indira is India” was not shared by all, many eminent personalities supported her step, at least initially. The Communist Party of India was all in support of the Emergency 

vement would have led to anarchy in the country. Later on, he was to change his view of the Emergency, especially in light of the atrocities that were perpetrated. Growth of Popular Discontent By mid-1976, the popular mood had changed: there was discontent everywhere as the economic improvement could not be sustained; the criminals were back at their work, and the welfare programmes failed to move at 

rcefully spread and were believed. The scale of the Emergency atrocities were more in the northern parts of the country than in the southern parts. This was to be reflected in the election results of 1977. In retrospect, the Emergency was one of the darkest periods of post-independent history of India; the two-yearlong period was also perhaps a very significant episode in the political evolution of th

e Indian National Congress. A lasting effect of the Emergency was to be felt in the way the Congress party worked since then. At the 1976 AICC session in Guwahati, the stage was set for sycophancy as an important political need. In fact, sycophancy was institutionalised and prepared the way for dynastic politics. The Guwahati session m

ongress cemented the rise to power by considering Sanjay to be the heir to the throne, so to say. On Sanjay’s death, Rajiv Gandhi was to step into the space created, even if reluctantly. Elections of 1977 The Emergency was extended twice, and then most unexpectedly Indira Gandhi called for elections. It is possible that with just sycophants reporting to her about the situation and the absence of a fre

 others observe that when she got an idea of the excesses being perpetrated she wanted to get out of a situation that was getting out of her control. The announcement of the elections came in January 1977. Political prisoners were released and press censorship lifted, even as political parties were allowed to campaign freely. Opposition Gets Together In the elections, the Congress of Indira Gandhi was

with the Janata Party. A Historic Election The Janata alliance made the excesses of the Emergency and the issue of civil liberties the major planks of its election campaign. The people voted in March 1977; the elections seemed to be practically a referendum on the Emergency. The Janata alliance got a huge mandate with 330 out of the 542 seats in the Lok Sabha. The Congress was trounced, especially in 

elections which brought a non-Congress government at the Centre for the first time since independence showed that democracy was well imbedded in the country. The Emergency came to an end on March 21, 1977. Developments in the Political System The elections over time showed how the voters had changed. The 1967 and the 1971 showed a marked increase in electoral malpractices with booth capturing and rigg

ng prominent, especially in Bihar, “vitiates in no mean degree the political atmosphere”. This feature has become practically entrenched in the country’s voting behaviour. Changes in the Congress The 1971 elections—the fifth general elections since India became independent—came earlier than the due date, thus dissociating the national elections from the elections for the state assemblies (the two had 

s. From now on, the inner party democracy within the Congress was to get more and more eroded. A lasting effect of the Emergency was to be felt in the way the Congress party worked since then. At the 1976  

 Gandhi was to step into the space created, even if reluctantly. Growth of Regional Interests Regional interests grew and took hold in many parts of the country. At the level of the states, after the 1967 elections the Congress had lost out in many; governments formed by the Samyukta Vidhayak Dal (SVD)—composed of the Jana Sangh, socialists, the Swatantra Party, and defectors from the Congress—came an

 gained prominence. The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), formed of the middle castes of the region and firmly anti-brahmin in its outlook, gained power in Madras; it came to power in the state in the 1967 elections with a huge majority and formed the first non-Congress government there under C.N. Annadurai. Since then, the state has in most elections brought to power either the DMK or the All India An

nder M.G. Ramachandran. In Kerala, the Congress failed; CPI and the CPM came together to form the government with E.M.S. Namboodiripad once again becoming the chief minister. In West Bengal after the 1969 election, the Congress lost power, and a coalition government was formed by the CPM and the Bangla Congress. Ajoy Mukherjee of the Bangla Congress was the chief minister and Jyoti Basu of the CPM, th

he alliance, and the state government also had problems with the Centre. There was also the conflict with the Naxalites, chiefly the Communist Party Marxists-Leninists, in short, the CP(ML) formed in 1969 and led by Charu Mazumdar, consisting of those rebels who left the CPM saying it had betrayed the ‘revolution’. It was in the Naxalbari area that bordered Nepal and Pakistan (at the time East Pakista

n) that the rural poor had been mobilised around 1967 by Kanu Sanyal of the CPM to demonstrate against landlords who had evicted tenants. The protests soon turned violent, leading to the beheading of some landlords. From the name of the place, the term 

h agitation demanding the creation of Telengana, with Hyderabad as its capital. The Naxalites also established themselves in the rural areas here. In Maharashtra, a new party Shiv Sena was founded in 1966 by Balasaheb Thackeray (more popularly called Bal Thackeray), a cartoonist, in Mumbai. This party was vociferous in its demand of ‘Bombay for Maharashtrians’, and targeted the South Indians residing 

 and the Shiv Sena came second to the Congress in the municipal elections of Bombay. The calls for greater autonomy were reflected in the border areas as well. Kashmir had gone through an election in 1967, which was, to all purposes unfair, with Congress candidates being elected without opposition as other candidates’ nomination papers were rejected. Sheikh Abdullah, under house arrest for some time, 

e position of Kashmir vis-à-vis India remained ambivalent, but according to some reports, he was more ready than before with the idea of Kashmir’s accession to India. After the Indo- Pakistani war of 1971, the new order in South Asia seemed to indicate that India’s control over Kashmir was quite firm. Sheikh Abdullah was in a mood for a more conciliatory approach to the Centre, and Indira Gandhi was r

but to limit his demand to just greater autonomy within the Indian Union. He became the Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir and the leader of the National Conference. There was relative peace and, in 1975, Indira Gandhi declared the state of Jammu and Kashmir to be a constituent of India.  

 In 1966, Indira Gandhi accepted the Akalis’ demand that Punjab be reorganised on linguistic lines. In consequence, the southern part of Punjab which was predominantly Hindispeaking became a separate state, H

 which the Akalis wanted to be the capital of Punjab alone, was declared a union territory to be shared by both the states as a capital. Though demonstrations over the status of Chandigarh went on in 1968 and 1969, and a veteran freedom fighter, Darshan Singh Pheruman, fasted unto death, the initially temporary arrangement continued indefinitely. The north-eastern region of India has a strategic impor

tance. The Mizos rose up against the Government of India in 1966, with the Mizo National Front (MNF) under the leadership of Laldenga demanding sovereign independence of Greater Mizoram. Indira Gandhi had to use the army to quell the rebellion; the air force carri

ed out strikes in Aizawl, the only time the IAF was used in this way in civilian Indian territory. With the 1971 war victory, the Mizo separatist movement slowed down. Negotiating with the Mizo leaders, the union government offered to turn Mizo Hills into a union territory in July 1971. The Mizo leaders accepte

d the offer on condition that the status of union territory would soon be upgraded to statehood. In January 1972, the Union Territory of Mizoram came into being. (Later, under Rajiv Gandhi as prime minister, Mizoram was to become a fullfledged state in 1987.) There was insurgency in Nagaland too. Nagaland had b

een a part of Assam at the time of India’s independence, but in 1963, it had become a separate state of India. But there were extremists in the state who demanded a separate identity outside the State of India. The radicals in charge of the movement were ready to get 

help and training from China. Violent clashes took place between the Naga rebels and the Indian Army. Indira Gandhi handled the situation with firmness, especially during the Emergency. In March 1975, president’s rule was imposed on the state. The leaders of the largest rebel groups agreed under the Shillong Accord in November 1975  

t the Indian Constitution. However, a small group did not agree and spurts of violence and conflict continued. Statehood had also, in the meanwhile, been granted to Meghalaya, Manipur, and Tripura in 1972, while the North- East Frontier Agency was made into a union territory and renamed Arunachal Pradesh. Annexation of Sikkim Sikkim had become a protectorate of India in 1950. By 1974, several election

of Sikkim, tried to suppress the movement but was not successful. He turned to India, and India prepared a constitution for Sikkim. The constitution was approved by the national assembly of Sikkim in 1974. In 1975, a special referendum was held in which an overwhelming majority of the electorate voted in favour of Sikkim’s merger with India. As a consequence, Sikkim was incorporated into the Indian Un

ion as its 22nd state in May 1975 after the Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Indian Constitution. Sikkim is of great strategic importance for India because of its location bordering on China. Language Policy to Curb the Anti-Hindi Distu

rbances Indira Gandhi assuaged the sentiments of the non-Hindi speaking states by getting the Official Languages Act amended in 1967 to provide that the use of English could continue until a resolution to end the use of the language was passed by the legislature of every state that had not adopted Hindi as its official language, a

vernment policy of bilingualism in India. The step led to the end of the anti-Hindi protests and riots in some states. Centralisation of Power and the Socialistic Path After she came back to power in 1967, Indira Gandhi improved upon what Lal Bahadur Shastri had begun—having  

 a number of advisers to the prime minister in the prime minister’s secretariat (which came to be known as the prime minister’s office when Morarji Desai became prime minister in 1977). The real expansion of the prime minister’s secretariat and its emergence as a power centre in its own right occurred under Indira Gandhi with P.N. Haksar becoming the first principal secretary to a

 a career diplomat, D.P. Dhar, politician-turned diplomat, P.N. Dhar, economistturned bureaucrat, and R.N. Kao, security analyst. Incidentally, the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) was established in 1968 on the CIA model, with Kao as its head. Haksar, with a firm orientation towards the Left, was the principal influence in the socialist path taken by Indira Gandhi. Her other advisers were also enthus

e. The court had obstructed the implementation of the abolition of privy purses as well as the nationalisation of banks (which was almost immediately implemented through a presidential ordinance). In 1971, the Twenty-fourth Constitutional Amendment  

d Parliament to amend any provision of the Constitution; this was to overcome the restrictions placed by the Supreme Court on Parliament regarding amendment of fundamental rights (Golaknath case). In 1972 came the Twenty-fifth Constitutional Amendment Act providing that giving effect to certain directive principles could not be challenged in court on the grounds of their being inconsistent with certai

n fundamental rights. In 1973, the practice of appointing the senior-most Supreme Court judge as the Chief Justice of India was set aside, and Justice A.N. Ray was made Chief Justice of India though there were three other judges 

 it greater powers to amend the Constitution had been challenged in the apex court, Justice Ray had voted in favour of the government’s view: this was seen as having influenced his promotion. Then in 1975 came the Thirty-eighth Amendment Act specifying that the satisfaction of the president or the governor to declare emergency or issue ordinances could not be challenged in court. The Thirty-ninth Amen

dment Act of 1975 provided that disputes regarding the election of the president, vice-president, speaker, and prime minister could not be heard by the high courts or Supreme Court, but only by a special court to be s

et up by Parliament. The Forty-second Amendment was to further curtail the power of the judiciary. The Forty-Second Amendment Act: A Mini Constitution of Sorts In 1976 came the Forty-second Constitutional Amendment Act that was the longest one till then and brought about sweeping changes in the Constitution, so much so that it came to be called a mini constitution 

 certain matters. Some of the huge changes the amendment brought about that affected the democratic system are given below. Some of these steps would be repealed by the Janata government that came in 1977. The 42nd Amendment placed amendments outside the purview of courts, further declaring that there was to be no limitation on the power of Parliament to amend the Constitution. It curtailed the powers

Constitution. The term of the Lok Sabha was extended from 5 years to 6 years. It further froze the number of seats in constituencies for election to Lok Sabha, and state legislative assemblies at the 1971 census level till the first census after 2000; there was to be no readjustment every 10 years after every census as was the practice till then. The laws made by Parliament to deal with anti-national 

ministration and lead to lower resources for economic development even as it increased bureaucratic control. Indira Gandhi then adopted the ordinance way to nationalise 14 major private banks in July 1969. The ordinance was later passed by Parliament to become the Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act. (In 1980, when Indira Gandhi came back to power, another six banks were n

 percentage of credit to the priority sectors (agriculture and small and medium industries). Differential interest rates scheme introduced in 1972 required the public sector banks to provide at lower than normal rates of interest to the weaker sections of the society. After being re-elected in 1971 on a campaign that endorsed nationalisation, I

The foreignowned private oil companies in India created obstructions for India by refusing to supply fuel to the Indian forces during the war of 1971. In consequence, Indira Gandhi nationalised the oil companies in 1973; since then, the major oil companies have to maintain a minimum stock of oil for military use when needed. Abolition of Princely 

uantum of these ‘purses’ ranged from Rs 5,000 per annum to Rs 26 lakh per annum. The privileges enjoyed by erstwhile rulers were often questioned and considered by many to be a relic of the past. The 1969 attempt by the Indira Gandhi government to abolish the ‘privy purse’ system and the official recognition of the titles did not meet with success: the Constitutional Amendment Bill to this effect was 

passed in the Lok Sabha, but it failed to get the required two-thirds majority in the Rajya Sabha. It was only in 1971 that with the passage of the Twenty-sixth Amendment to the Constitution of India that the privy purses were abolished.  

nd obligations in respect of privy purses.” Thus, Article 363-A was inserted in the Constitution. Besides, the abolition of the privy purses would reduce the government’s revenue deficit. MRTP Act In 1969, the Indira Gandhi government was able to get the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices (MRTP) Act passed after abolishing the managing agency system; the latter, it was thought, enabled a small

m effect of bringing to prominence middle-ranking farmers from the lower castes. And these classes were to pose a challenge in the political system in the North. Tackling Economic Problems In the mid-1960s, Indian economy was going through a crisis. There was shortage of food grains, a huge fiscal deficit, and a deterioration in the balance of payments situation. This led to a greater dependence on fo

reign aid. The war with Pakistan in 1965 resulted in the suspension of food aid from the US, which refused to renew the PL-480 agreement. In the circumstances, five-year planning was suspended in favour of annual plans (between 1966 and 196

 did devalue the rupee in June 1966 by 36.5 per cent, increasing the dollar’s value against it by 57.4 per cent. (According to B.K. Nehru’s account in Nice Guys Finish Second, Lal Bahadur Shastri had decided upon devaluation as early a

s January 1966 before he went to Tashkent.) The idea behind the step was that devaluation would help India sell more abroad and get the dollars to pay for its imports of food, oil, and capital goods. The step was s

on thus came to be seen as a failure. The medium-term effect of devaluation was, in fact, beneficial: India managed to avert famine as well as bankruptcy, and the trade deficit reduced drastically by 1970–71. In the short term, however, it led to inflation and failed to the extent that it was not accompanied by other reforms. In the circumstances, the idea of liberalising the economy became politicall

 harvests in 1972. Of course, the success of the Green Revolution helped to restore the food economy. Fourth Five-Year Plan The much postponed Fourth Five-Year Plan (1969–74) was at last launched. Its investment outlay was almost double than that of the Third Plan. The goal was stated to be “growth with stability and progressive achievement of self-reliance”. The plan

 was dovetailed to the socialist principles adopted by Indira Gandhi by then. The rationale was the Ten Point Programme put forward by Indira Gandhi in 1967, her first economic policy formulation soon after taking office of prime minister. The programme placed an emphasis on greater state control of the economy as it was believed that government control 

ensured greater welfare than leaving the economy to the private sector. So, the private sector needed to be regulated. By the end of the 1960s, the liberalisation process had been reversed and India’s policies could be called as ‘protectionist’. The government intended that India should be free of dependence on foreign aid and emphasise on

, though many of the social goals were realised. The shortfall in targets was mainly because the war with Pakistan and dealing with the refugees from East Pakistan took their toll, and because of the 1973 oil crisis. Green Revolution Success The bright spot on the economic scene was the success of the new agricultural strategy. The Green Revolution, the seeds of which had been sown in Lal Bahadur Shas

e damage to the environment overuse of chemical fertilisers and wastage of water. But at the time, the feeling was that endemic food shortage had ended. Fifth Five-Year Plan The Fifth Five-year Plan (1974–79) did not last its full term, but its programmes mostly coincided with the Emergency period. The plan was targeted at reducing poverty through addressing the consumption needs of the poor and by en

re or less an aspect of the Twenty Point Programme. With the Emergency in place, the economic programmes could be implemented forcefully. Indeed, with the economy growing at the rate of 9 per cent in 1975–76 alone, the Fifth Plan was the first plan during which the per capita income grew by over 5 per cent. However, with the elections of 1977 and the Janata government coming to power, the Fifth Plan p

eriod was curtailed and it was ended in 1978. The Indo-Pak War of 1971 and the Birth of Bangladesh The war between India and Pakistan in 1971 was a milestone in that it saw the liberation of East Pakistan resulting in the birth of a new nation, Bangladesh. The 1970 Polls in Pakistan and Unrest in East Pakistan In 1970, General Yahya Khan, 

ple in the higher administrative sections of the country. Mujibur Rahman demanded greater autonomy and a true federal constitution with greater powers for the East wing. The poll was held in December 1970 and the results showed where Pakistan was heading. While the PPP won a majority of seats in West Pakistan, the Awami League simply swept the elections in East Pakistan and, in the process, got a majo

he endorsement of Zulfiqar Bhutto postponed convening the National Assembly. This angered the East Pakistanis, and the call for a general strike by the Awami League met with a good response. In March 1971, the Pakistani military regime took steps to crush the protest and sent tanks and forces into East Pakistan. Mujibur Rahman was arrested and moved to an unknown destination. There seemed little chanc

lux in India and Indian Response One consequence of the civil war in East Pakistan was the exodus of refugees (mostly Hindus) from that country into India, the numbers running into millions by August 1971. India allowed these refugees in and set up camps for them (in West Bengal, Tripura, and Meghalaya, and even in Madhya  

t a letter from the US president asking India to send back the refugees under UN supervision. Indira Gandhi pointed out that the American arms given to Pakistan, which were once used against India in 1965, were now being used by Pakistan against its own people. She also asked if the refugees from Hitler’s Germany would have been repatriated under the conditions that existed at the time. It is now know

uld act as a deterrent to Pakistan and China if they thought of getting together and indulging in military adventurism. When India’s foreign minister at the time, Swaran Singh, visited Moscow in June 1971 and met his Soviet counterpart, Andrei Gromyko, and the president, Alexei Kosygin, it was decided that such a friendship treaty would be signed. In August 1971, the foreign ministers of the two count

By the summer of 1971, India had decided to intervene actively in the situation. Indian forces began to provide instruction in the use of weapons to Bengali guerrillas in training camps. The group of these fighters, compr

In November 1971, Richard Nixon and Indira Gandhi met but did not agree on the situation; Nixon said that the US would not agree to overthrow Yahya Khan and warned India against taking military action.

War and Liberation of East Pakistan Pakistan chose to attack India on the western border on December 3, 1971. As their bombers targeted airfields along the western borders, their artillery regiments attacked Kashmir. India, under the generalship of Sam Manekshaw, took swift action in Kashmir and Punjab on t

istan. From December 4 onwards, the aircraft carrier INS Vikrant was deployed to carry out attacks on the major ports of East Pakistan. India’s intention for East Pakistan became clear on December 6, 1971 when the Indian government formally recognised the Provisional Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh. The US sent Task Force 74 led by the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise into the Bay of 

lso cause its disintegration. On December 13, the Yahya Khan sent a message to Lieutenant-General A.A.K. Niazi, the Commander of the Pakistan Eastern Command, to give up arms. But it was December 16, 1971 before the Instrument of Surrender of Pakistan Eastern Command stationed in East Pakistan, was signed between the Lieutenant-General Jagjit Singh Aurora, the GOC-in-C of Indian Eastern Command and Li

esigned and Zulfiqar Bhutto took over. Bhutto was reported to be in favour of beginning a new relationship with India. India was not against the idea. Bhutto was invited for a summit at Simla in June 1972. At the meeting, the Indians expressed the need for a comprehensive treaty settling all outstanding problems including Kashmir. But the Pakistanis preferred a step by step approach. In the end, where

Neither side shall seek to alter it unilaterally, irrespective of mutual differences and legal interpreta

stan’s National Assembly soon after the agreement indicated that the Kashmir issue was very much alive and that Pakistan was ready to help the people of Kashmir if they started a freedom movement. In 1976, in spite of the Pokhran nuclear test by India and the hostile reception to it in Pakistan, the two countries agreed to reopen diplomatic establishments and normalise relations. Foreign Policy and Re

did not meet with approval of many in the political and military circles of Bangladesh as they feared Bangladesh would become some kind of satellite state to India. Mujibur Rahman was assassinated in 1975, following which came Islamist and military regimes. Indira Gandhi’s relations with these regimes was uncomfortable. But, on the whole, the relations between the two countries remained amicable. Sri 

ka Indira Gandhi had cordial relations with her Sri Lankan counterpart, Sirimavo Bandaranaike, and was initially accommodative about the ethnic problem involving the Tamils in that island country. In 1974, India ceded the tiny islet of Katchatheevu to Sri Lanka in order to save Bandaranaike’s socialist government from a political disaster. In 1974, India ceded the small islet Katchatheevu to Sri Lanka

abilise the Bandranaike regime in Sri Lanka. The agreement, which did not specify fishing rights, allowed Indian fishermen to fish around Katchatheevu and to dry their nets on the island. However, in 1976, without consulting the Tamil Nadu assembly or Parliament Indira Gandhi’s government finalised another agreement to determine  

 of armed forces by India and Pakistan after Pakistan began the attack on the western front, the Soviet Union vetoed the resolution. Though the Soviet Union was not happy with India’s nuclear test of 1974, it did not support further action against India. Certainly, there was a tilt towards the Soviet Union for pragmatic reasons during the times of Indira Gandhi. United States From the time Indira Gand

By 1974, the relations had recovered enough for Iran and India to come to an agreement that led to Iran supplying a substantial amount of crude to India.

Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, and Libya— the countries that had supported India during the Sino-Indian War in 1962 got special attention after she came to power. Diplomatic and economic relations with these states were expanded. Unlike her father, Indira Gandhi openly supported the liberation struggles in Africa.

 India’s image too had improved in the world with the nuclear test and the refusal to be bullied by the US in the Indo-Pak War of 1971. Furthermore, Indira Gandhi firmly connected the Indian antiimperialist interests in Africa and those of the Soviet Union. The experience of Indians in Uganda, however, was depressing: they suffered 

 detonation of a nuclear device. On May 18, 1974, India conducted its first nuclear test in the Thar Desert of Rajasthan, at the army base near the village of Pokhran. Officially termed Pokhran I but code-named ‘Smiling Buddha’, the exercise was an

 India’s domination in the subcontinent. The Indian test, according to Pakistani opinion, pushed Pakistan into the nuclear field. The Janata Party Years (March 1977 – January 1980) The Janata Party contesting under the symbol of ‘chakrahaldhar’ and its allies won a massive majority in the 1977 elections. Morarji Desai the First Non-Congress Prime Minister There were three cont

 Jagjivan Ram. It was left to Acharya Kripalani and Jayaprakash Narayan to decide who would become prime minister. Their choice was Morarji Desai who duly took the oath as prime minister on March 23, 1977. Charan Singh (minister of home, and later of finance) and Jagjivan Ram (defence minister) were deputy prime ministers. Fresh State Assembly Elections It was felt that the nation had expressed its di

nference not doing so well in Jammu. New President of India With a hold on most states, the Janata Party was able to get its candidate, Neelam Sanjiva Reddy, elected as the President of India in June 1977. The presidential election was necessitated by the death of Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed in February of that year. Downslide of the Janata and Rise of Congress (I) The Janata government began with full popul

The Congress split once again in January 1978; the group led by Indira Gandhi becoming the Congress-I (for Indira). Her party won the Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh state assembly elections, defeating the Janata Party as well as the rival Congress

i and Charan Singh, who was not satisfied with his second number position in the cabinet, grew to such an extent that Desai was forced to dismiss Charan Singh as well as Raj Narain from office in mid-1978. Charan Singh retaliated by organising a farmers’ protest march to Delhi in December 1978. In an effort to keep peace, Charan Singh was recalled to the cabinet by Desai in February 1979 and allotted 

h’s party walked out of the coalition reducing the government to a minority. Desperate bids to get support from the Congress factions did not succeed and the Morarji Desai government resigned in July 1979. Charan Singh the Prime Minister Who Never Faced Parliament In a brazen show of opportunism, Charan Singh negotiated with his erstwhile bitter enemy Indira Gandhi to get support for a government led 

 elections called for. Charan Singh remained caretaker prime minister till elections could take place. Fresh Lok Sabha Elections and End of Janata Party Rule Lok Sabha elections took place in January 1980. The parties in the fray were the Congress (I), Congress (U), Lok Dal, the new party floated by Charan Singh and the Socialists, and Janata, now consisting primarily of Jana Sangh and of the old Cong

The Forty-third Amendment passed in 1977 deleted Article 3ID which gave powers to Parliament to curtail even legitimate trade union activity under the guise of preventing anti-national activities. Ratified by more than half the states as re

itutional validity of central laws, thus making it possible for persons living in distant places to seek justice without having to come all the way to the Supreme Court. The Forty-fourth Amendment of 1978 made the promulgation of Emergency more difficult than it was. It would now require the ‘written advice’ of the cabinet and not the prime minister alone before the president could proclaim Emergency.

achievement of major economic reforms difficult. With Charan Singh in a prominent position, it was inevitable that agriculture and the rural sector got importance. The Sixth Five-Year Plan (meant for 1978–83 but also curtailed due to change of regime in 1980), launched by the government after curtailing the Fifth Plan, aimed to boost agricultural production and rural industries. It was called the roll

mic situation. The government failed to work on the radical reforms the party had promised in the run-up to the elections. There were some bright spots. The Food for Work programme, launched in April 1977, envisaged some of the stocks of food grains with the government to be used for payment as wages in kind to workers in rural areas who helped to build roads and water ponds during the season when agr

 One of the firsts in foreign relations of the Janata government was the effort at normalisation of ties with the People’s Republic of China. In 1979, Vajpayee became the highest-ranking Indian official so far to visit Beijing to meet the Chinese leaders. Diplomatic ties were re-established between India and China; ties had been suspended since th

e 1962 war. The two sides agreed to establish regular dialogue to resolve long-standing territorial disputes, expand trade, and improve border security. Social Changes and Movements The late 1970s, observes Ramachandra Guha, saw a churn in political and social terms. Politicians seemed to have abandoned ideology in favour of expediency and the polity had become fragmented. On the social level

The Janata government in January 1979 appointed the Second Backward Classes Commission, popularly known as the Mandal Commission after its chairman Bindeshwari Prasad Mandal, a former chief minister of Bihar. Its remit was to examine whe

again. Indira Gandhi trusted very few and had come to rely more and more on her son, Sanjay, who had also been elected to the Lok Sabha. She was not ready to share power with anyone else. But in June 1980 Sanjay died when he tried out some stunts in the plane he was flying and lost control. And Rajiv Gandhi, Indira’s elder son, an airline pilot with no experience in politics, was reluctantly forced in

st people knew he was heir apparent to the Congress leadership. Economy Indira Gandhi paid immediate attention to the economy. The Janata Sixth Five-Year Plan was curtailed and a new Sixth Year Plan (1980–85) was launched. The objectives of the new Sixth Five-Year Plan India were mainly focused on increasing growth and industrialisation and reducing poverty and unemployment. There was to be promotion 

ged, designed to ensure that all parts of the country attained, within a prescribed period, nationally accepted standards. The Integrated Rural Development Programme (IRDP) was launched on October 2, 1980 all over the country. The National Rural Employment Programme (NREP), launched in October 1980, became a regular programme under the Plan from April 1981.  

 The National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development was established for the development of rural sector in 1982 on the recommendation of the Shivaraman Committee. The Sixth Plan is considered to have initiated the first steps towards economic liberalisation, with the government subsequently launching Operation

 Forward in 1982. They were the first cautious attempt at reform, but they were too cautious to have much effect. Indira Gandhi was wary of the multinational companies eroding the country’s self-reliance. Improvement

ental aspects of the country was also to be given attention, according to the Sixth Plan. It is worth recalling that Indira Gandhi had attended and spoken at the first UN conference on environment in 1972. In her earlier stint as prime minister, she was behind the implementation of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 and the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act of 1974. The Wildlife Protect

ion Act facilitated the establishment of wildlife sanctuaries and national parks, and Project Tiger was launched in 1973. Now, in her second stint in power, the Forest (Conservation) Act of 1980, and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act of 1981 were enacted. Foreign Relations Sri Lanka and Tamils Problem In the area of foreign relations, Indira Gandhi was unhappy with Sri Lanka’

om socialism after Sirimavo Bandaranaike lost power to J.R. Jayewardene, who, Indira Gandhi felt was a puppet of the West. Though it is alleged that India under Indira supported LTTE militants in the 1980s to pressurise Jayewardene to be sensitive of Indian interests, the Indian prime minister refused demands that India attack Sri Lanka after the incidents of Black July 1983, in which Sinhalese mobs t

argeted the Tamils of Sri Lanka. Pakistan: Siachen Conflict India-Pakistan relations reached low depths after the rise to power of General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq in Pakistan in 1978. It was strongly felt in India that General Zia supported Khalistani militants in Punjab. In 1984, there were military skirmishes on the border. In the end, it became a conflict over the Siachen  

t an Indian went travelling in space. As a part of the joint programme between Indian Space Research Organisation and the Soviet Intercosmos, Rakesh Sharma, an Indian Air Force pilot, was selected in 1982 as a cosmonaut for a joint Soviet-Indian spaceflight. On April 2, 1984, Sharma flew on board Soyuz T-11 with two Soviet cosmonauts to the space station Salyut 7. During his stay of nearly eight days 

ff the glacier ultimately feeds the Indus, crucial to both countries. The roots of the conflict lie in the lack of proper demarcations of the territory on the map beyond the map coordinate known as NJ9842. Before 1984, neither India nor Pakistan had any permanent presence in the area. However, in order to reinforce their claim on the area, the Pakistanis encouraged expeditions to the glacier on the ba

sis of permits given by their government. Becoming aware of this in about 1978, an Indian Army expedition was also sent to Teram Kangri peaks as a counter-exercise. To free the glacier from Pakistani domination, the Indian armed forces launched Operation Meghdoot in April 1984,

La, were secured by India while Pakistan retained control of the Gyong La pass. Non-Aligned Movement Under Indira Gandhi, India reasserted its prominence in the Non-Aligned Movement. India hosted the 1983 summit of NAM at Delhi, and thus  

ion which wanted the Bengalis out of the state in fear of being culturally dominated. In Andhra Pradesh a new political party under the aegis of N.T. Rama Rao, a very popular film star, was formed in 1982. The Telugu Desam party spoke for the self-respect of the Telugu-speaking people. And his party came to power in the state elections at the end of the year. Punjab Turmoil and Operation Blue Star The

 river water as well. In 1973, the Akalis had brought out the Anandpur Resolution that on one level just demanded greater autonomy—as did all states. On another level, by using the term ‘Sikh nation’, it lent itself to the interp

e Congress as a counterpoise to the Akalis. If so, he became a Frankenstein’s monster, and very soon broke free to create an independent image of himself. He attracted a large number of followers. In 1980, the Akalis suffered a blow when they were dismissed from power in the state and the Congress came to power. The impetus to form a state free of India was given mainly by Sikhs in England, US, and Ca

nada. In June 1980, a group of students meeting at the Golden Temple in Amritsar declared the formation of an independent Sikh republic— Khalistan; its president was to be Jagjit Singh Chauhan from London. The situatio

n bringing him to book. In an effort to up the ante against Bhindranwale, the Akalis became more extreme in their views. Their legislators resigned en masse from the state assembly on Republic Day of 1983. It seemed to indicate that their commitment to the Indian Constitution was not firm. Bhindranwale, in the meantime, was becoming more virulent towards the Hindus in his speeches and instigating Sikh

iorate. Khalistani terrorists, reported to be encouraged by Pakistan, were slowly entrenching themselves in Punjab and killings took place to eliminate prominent Hindus and Sikh officials. In October 1983, a bus was stopped and the Hindu passengers on it shot. The Centre imposed President’s Rule on the state. Bhindranwale moved without facing any hindrance into the Akal Takht, the seat of temporal aut

hority for the Sikhs near the Golden Temple, which was the seat of spiritual authority. By 1984 beginning, Bhindranwale and his associates had begun to fortify the Golden Temple complex and arms and ammunition as well as food stocked. It was all under the command of Shubeg Singh, once a major g

m it. Clearly, strong action needed to be taken. Indira Gandhi gave her permission to initiate Operation Blue Star on the recommendation of Army Chief A.S. Vaidya. By the night of June 25 and June 3, 1984, curfew had been imposed on the state of Punjab, all means of communication and public travel suspended, and electricity supply interrupted. Media was strictly censored. It was on the night of June 5

 But the assassination of a prime minister is also to be seen as the result of Operation Blue Star. On the morning of October 31, 1984, while walking over from her house to her office, she was shot by her Sikh security guards, Beant Singh and Satwant Singh. She was rushed to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, but she did n

d decisiveness in the face of external aggression, however, was exemplary. She showed that India was not to be bullied and brought the country to prominence in the world map. The Rajiv Years (October 1984 – December 1989) Problems at the Very Outset Appointed prime minister after the assassination of his mother, Indira Gandhi, on October 31, 1984, Rajiv Gandhi faced major problems from the very outset

endence. The silver lining in an otherwise dark spot in India’s history lay in the efforts made by many Hindus to hide and help Sikh families during the rioting. The Bhopal Gas Tragedy On December 3, 1984, India faced another great tragedy: a leak of the toxic methyl isocyanate (MIC) gas from the pesticide plant of the US multinational company Union Carbide (UCC) at Bhopal killed thousands and left ma

he villages and slums in the neighbouring areas of the factory. View Though we boast of being the world’s largest democracy and Delhi being its national capital, the sheer mention of the incidents of 1984 anti-Sikh riots in general and the role played by Delhi Police and state machinery in particular makes our heads hang in shame in the eyes of the world polity. Delhi High Court in 2009  

 by an American attorney in a US court. And the legal battles and machinations began with the ethical implications of the tragedy and its effect on the people being pushed to the background. In March 1985, the Bhopal Gas Leak Disaster Act was enacted by the Indian government so as to ensure speedy and equitable settlement of claims arising from the accident. As per the act, the government became the s

ave India for the US without being arrested. The controversy continues and so do the troubles of the people who suffered from the fallout of the gas leak and had to do with such low compensation. The 1985 General Elections Rajiv Gandhi on assuming the post of prime minister in October 1984 recommended early elections. General elections were to be held in January 1985; instead, they were held in Decemb

er 1984. The Congress (I) won an overwhelming majority, securing more than 400 seats, the largest ever majority in independent India’s Lok Sabha election history till then. The mandate was partly the result 

 assumed the post of prime minister, was also the youngest person to do so in India. The March 1985 elections to assemblies in 11 states brought the Congress (I) to power in 8 of them. Tackling the Tensions in States Several ethnic conflicts raged in different parts of the country when Rajiv Gandhi

ed, but others continued to cause trouble. Punjab was a burning problem. Akali leaders were freed and an agreement was signed by the Akali leader Sant Harcharan Singh Longowal and Rajiv Gandhi in July1985. But in August, Longowal was shot dead. However, state elections were held in September and in what was seen as a vote against extremism, the Akali Dal came to power with a comfortable majority. But 

ilitants. This time round, strong—in fact, even ruthless—action by the police under J.F. Ribeiro and K.P.S. Gill brought the situation under control, after Operation Black Thunder was launched in May 1988 to flush out militants from the Golden Temple. It was a smoother and cleaner operation, but then there was no charismatic leader like Bhindranwale this time round to whip up emotions. Even so, milita

ncy did not quite die down for quite some time in the state. The Chandigarh issue continues to rankle. Assam was torn by violent agitation in the 1970s and the 1980s over the influx of foreigners. Rajiv Gandhi and the All Assam Students Union (AASU) signed an accord on August 15, 1985. President’s Rule was removed and elections held in December. The AASU became 

a political party—the Asom Gana Parishad—and contested the polls; it emerged victorious leaving the Congress far behind. Yet another agreement was that between the Centre and the Mizos in 1986, whereby the Mizo rebels surrendered their arms. Mizoram was granted statehood. The Mizo National Front under the leadership of Laldenga—once a fiery rebel calling for secession from India—came to po

wer as chief minister of Mizoram which became the 23rd state of India in February 1987.  

Bengalis who had come into the state after Partition. The Tripura National Volunteers (TNV) adopted the way of terrorists intimidating civilians and the police with kidnappings and murders. In August 1988, a memorandum of understanding was signed under which TNV decided to abjure violence, give up secessionist demands, and to hold negotiations for a peaceful solution of all the problems of Tripura wit

ter of the state, but Indira Gandhi had removed him. Now, with Rajiv Gandhi as prime minister, the Congress and the National Conference formed a coalition caretaker government in Jammu and Kashmir in 1986. Elections were held in 1987. The Muslim United Front (MUF) formed by a group of Kashmiris who sought greater autonomy from the Centre was also in the fray. There was wide-ranging rigging in the elec

to cut red tape and make the administration more open and less rigid. Anti-Defection Act One of the first things Rajiv Gandhi did as prime minister was to get the anti-defection law passed in January 1985. As a result, an elected member of a legislature at the central or state level could not join an opposition party until the next election, or he/she would be disqualified as a member of the house. Th

m the government. Environmental Legislation An outcome of the Bhopal tragedy was the increase in environmental awareness and activism in India. Rajiv Gandhi as prime minister responded positively. In 1986 came the Environment Protection Act (EPA) under which the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) was created, with overall responsibility for administering and enforcing environmental laws and po

to the Centre to issue direct orders to close, prohibit, or regulate any industry. An enabling law, it delegates wide powers to the executive, allowing it to make rules to manage different issues. In 1987,  

 amendments to the Factories Act, 1948 empowered states to appoint site appraisal committees to guide the location of factories using hazardous processes. Systems were also set up to ensure the safety of workers and nearby residents and e

mergency disaster control plans specified. By 1989, the Hazardous Waste (Management and Handling) Rules had been enacted for management, storage, and import of hazardous chemicals. But it would be 1991 before the enactment of the Public Liability Insurance Act to provide for immediate relief to persons affected by accidents while handling hazardous substances. Improving Local Government Rajiv Gandh

 of his term as prime minister, Rajiv Gandhi, faced with several problems in the country, went back to populism. Taxes were increased on consumer durables and air travel made more expensive. In April 1989, the National Rural Employment Programme (NREP) and the  

ged. As a result of these measures, India was soon to emerge as a major software exporter. Some people have called these steps as initiating the ‘information revolution’ in India. Education Policy In 1968, the government under Indira Gandhi launched the first national Policy of Education (NPE). In 1986, Rajiv Gandhi promulgated the new NPE that stressed on “special emphasis on the removal of dispariti

al Open University (IGNOU), a byproduct of this policy, was directed towards promoting adult education. The concept of having a Navodaya Vidyalaya in every district of India was born as a part of the 1986 NPE, the aim being to provide excellence along with social justice. These residential schools were meant to provide quality education free of charge to children of poor families, chosen by merit, who

uld stay in the schools. The Negative Side There were several areas in which the Rajiv Gandhi government failed to act in a statesmanlike manner or made grave tactical mistakes. The Shah Bano Case In 1985, the Supreme Court gave a decision in a case involving a Muslim divorcee, Shah Bano, upholding the decision of a lower court. The lower court verdict was that Shah Bano’s erstwhile husband should pay

 of Muslims demonstrating against the Supreme Court decision, the Rajiv Gandhi government bowed to the pressure. The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Bill was introduced in the House in 1986 to overturn the Supreme Court judgement and a whip issued to Congress MPs to vote in its favour. The bill was passed, thereby denying divorced Muslim women the right to claim maintenance under the Cr

h times, the Babri Mosque in Ayodhya was used by Muslims for worship; there was a platform outside the mosque where Hindus worshipped Ram. It was believed that the place was the birthplace of Ram. In 1949, an idol of Ram Lalla (baby) is said to have been placed inside the mosque one night. Hindu devotees saw this appearance of the idol as a miracle and now wanted the place for worship. In the wake of 

peals were made before Faizabad court that the Ram Janmabhoomi gates be unlocked on the grounds that it was the Faizabad district administration, and not a court, that had ordered its closure. In the 1980s, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and other such Hindu groups launched a campaign to construct a Ram Mandir at the site. On February 1, 1986, the Faizabad district judge ordered that the doors to the

y of appeasement of communities for electoral gains could become a vicious cycle and cause much damage to the social fabric. The Bofors Scandal There was more trouble for the prime minister. In March 1986, India signed an agreement with the Swedish arms manufacturer AB Bofors (once owned by Alfred Nobel) for the supply of four hundred 155mm Howitzer guns for the Indian Army. The deal included an optio

n to license-produce 1,000 more guns. The deal amounted to $285 million (about Rs 1,500 crore), which was huge for the time. Almost a year later, in April 1987, a Swedish radio report claimed that the Bofors deal involved payment of bribes to top Indian politicians and defence personnel as well as Swedish officials.  

bout Rajiv Gandhi’s declaration in Parliament that no bribe was paid and no middleman was involved. Rajiv Gandhi who had been nicknamed ‘Mr Clean’ suffered an irreparable damage to his image. In July 1988, Rajiv Gandhi introduced what has been termed as one of the most draconian bills drafted by the Indian government. The bill was aimed at checking the freedom of the press: it provided that an editor 

Bofors scandal. The bill was in the end dropped, but further damage had been done to the image of the government. Agrarian Unrest The failure of monsoons still plagued the country, and the drought in 1987 was severe, causing much rural distress. Kalahandi district in Orissa was particularly affected. The discontent in the countryside went beyond the rain-fed areas to the irrigated areas. Farmers’ orga

Despite moving closer to the West, Rajiv Gandhi did not succumb to pressure on the nuclear non-proliferation issue which he linked, as Indian policy had always done, to universal disarmament. In June 1988, at the 15th special session of the United Nations General Assembly, Rajiv spoke about a world free of nuclear weapons, and put forward his ‘Action Plan for Ushering in a Nuclear-Weapon Free and Non-

Violent World Order’. In 1986, the President of Seychelles faced a coup and sought India’s help. The Rajiv Gandhi government authorised the Indian Navy to reach the coasts of Seychelles to help avert the coup in a mission named ‘

Operation Flowers are Blooming’. Then, in 1988, Maldives faced an attempted coup whose perpetrator was apparently assisted by armed mercenaries of a Tamil secessionist organisation from Sri Lanka, the People’s  

on of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE). The Maldives government sought India’s help, upon which Rajiv Gandhi ordered the deployment of the Indian forces in an operation code-named Cactus. The coup was averted. In 1987, India re-occupied the Quaid Post in the disputed Siachen region in what was termed Operation Rajiv. In December 1988, Rajiv Gandhi became the first Indian prime minister since Jawaharlal Nehru in 19

54 to visit China. In 1986–87, there had been a standoff between Indian and Chinese troops at Sumdorong Chu on the north-eastern border. However, Rajiv Gandhi’s visit led to better relations. He had a cordial meeting with Deng

 relief supplies to the beleaguered Tamils by sea. A flotilla of Indian ships with relief supplies was locked by the Sri Lankan Navy as they approached the territorial waters of Sri Lanka. On June 4, 1987, the Indian government ordered relief supplies to be air-dropped into the area on humanitarian grounds—in what was called Operation Poomalai (also Eagle-Mission-4)— after warning Sri Lanka not to try

ssed regret over the incident but added no further comment. India wanted the airdrop to send a message; the siege of Jaffna was lifted, and there was a declaration of ceasefire. Indo-Sri Lanka Accord 1987 In July 1987, the Sri Lankan president, J.R. Jayawardene, asked Rajiv Gandhi to mediate in the island country’s ethnic conflict. As a result, the Indo-Sri Lanka Peace Accord was signed by the two lea

ders in Colombo on July 29, 1987. Incidentally, it was on the occasion of this visit to Colombo that Rajiv Gandhi was assaulted by a Sri Lankan in the Guard of Honour held for the Indian prime minister in what seemed an attempted as

f the operation was huge. Back in India, the pressure was on the government to recall the force. In the end, the IPKF misadventure was to be the cause for the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi on May 21, 1991 during his election campaign in Tamil Nadu. At Sriperumbudur, a woman bent to touch his feet and exploded an explosive device attached to her. The suicide bomber belonged to the LTTE and her action w

as in retaliation of India’s role in Sri Lanka. General Elections of 1989 V.P. Singh, on leaving the Congress, floated the Jan Morcha along with Arun Nehru and Arif Mohammed Khan, both of whom had parted ways with Rajiv Gandhi. Later, this group merged with the Janata Part

 regional parties (which included the DMK, the Telugu Desam party, and the Asom Gana Parishad) in a coalition which came to be called the National Front. In November 1989, general elections were held for the Lok Sabha. By then, the opposition to Rajiv Gandhi had consolidated, and a coordinated strategy was adopted. The Congress did badly in the elections, though it st

ill manged to be the largest single party in the Lok Sabha. People had lost faith in Rajiv Gandhi in the face of the accusations of corruption. The 1989 election was the first in which no single party got a majority on its own. At that time itself, some commentators indicated that the elections marked a milestone, the beginning of coalitions, and a p

eriod of political instability. Rajiv Gandhi resigned in December 1989. His party chose to sit in the opposition as it did not have the majority or the support to form the government after the elections. The V.P. Singh Years (December 1989 – November 1990) The National 

Front did not have a majority of its own in the Lok Sabha after the 1989 elections. But it staked the claim to form the government and did so with the BJP and the Left parties offering to support it from the outside. Vishwanath Pratap Singh was sworn in as India’s prime m

inister on December 2, 1989. Rajiv Gandhi, as head of the Congress party, was leader of the opposition in the Lok Sabha. Soon, after state legislative elections in March 1990, the governing coalition at the Centre achieved control of both houses of Parliament. One of the first decisions taken by V.P. Singh was to recall the IPKF from Sri Lanka. V.P. Singh was prime minist

er for less than a year, but he faced major problems in that short period. Kashmir Situation Worsens In Kashmir, in December 1989, militants of the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) kidnapped the daughter of  

he Hizb-ul Mujahideen led by Syed Salauddin, with more hard core ideas of turning the state into an Islamic regime. Salauddin, incidentally, had left mainstream politics after the rigged elections of 1987. With armed attacks on banks and grenade attacks on police stations, the militants were becoming more defiant and daring. The Centre decided to take strong action and sent in forces to control the si

ugee camps and makeshift buildings, afraid to go back. Implementation of the Mandal Commission Report The Mandal Commission appointed during the Janata Party rule had submitted its report in December 1980. The Congress governments under Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi had quietly shelved the report. The Mandal Commission or the Backward Classes Commission—to give it its official name—said that caste an

states a large proportion of government jobs were reserved for the non-brahmins, and, it was pointed out by those who agreed with the Mandal recommendations, efficiency had not suffered. On August 7, 1990, V.P. Singh announced in Parliament that his government had accepted the Mandal Commission report and would implement 27 per cent reservation at all levels of central government services for the Soci

Also, the proportion of upper castes in the population in the south was less compared to the north. [The matter had been taken to the Supreme Court which stayed the order. But it was only in November 1992 that the nine-judge bench of the court gave its decision. Six judges upheld the constitutionality of the Mandal Commission as well as the government order based on its recommendations.  

y harmful. Even the Congress which had been lukewarm to the matter had realised the importance of the OBC factor in winning elections in the north. The Narasimha Rao government which came to power in 1991 had already issued a fresh order in September 1991 in favour of the Mandal recommendations, with a condition attached that within the 27 per cent reservation preference would be given to the poorer s

 the Hindus. The party president, L.K. Advani, decided to set out on a yatra or tour in a rath (which was a van converted to look like a chariot). The Ram rath yatra beginning in Somnath in September 1990 was to culminate in Ayodhya after touring several of the states in between. V.P. Singh faced a dilemma; whatever he did—stop the procession or let it continue—would prove counterproductive for the go

rs of the mandir, and there were communal clashes as well. The BJP withdrew its support to the National Front government. V.P. Singh lost the confidence vote in the Lok Sabha and resigned in November 1990. The Chandra Shekhar Government (November 1990 – June 1991) With the imminence of the fall of the V.P. Singh government, Chandra Shekhar and Devi Lal had left the Janata Dal along with several others

o support from outside a minority government, this time led by Chandra Shekhar who had just 64 MPs with him. Chandra Shekhar won a confidence motion and was sworn in as prime minister on November 10, 1990. Troubled Economy The economic situation was in a bad shape, and foreign exchange levels had reduced to a dangerous low. The economic crisis was mainly due to the large and growing fiscal imbalances 

over the 1980s. The loans that earlier governments under Congress had taken from world financial institutions and, in Rajiv Gandhi’s case, from the market had created a huge debt. India was struggling to finance i

ts essential imports, especially of oil and fertilisers, and to repay official debt. The situation was made worse because of the Gulf war and the resultant hike in oil prices. By January 1991, the Chandra Shekhar government, with Yashwant Sinha as the finance minister, had convinced IMF to approve two loans. In return, the government promised to initiate economic reforms through the budge

ginning of the budget session, the Congress withdrew its support to the government on some flimsy grounds, with the result that the minority government was unable to present the full budget. In March 1991, the government was forced to pledge gold reserves of the country to manage the foreign exchange situation. According to news reports, economic advisers to the prime minister pointed out India could 

dia, it was this move that helped meet the balance of payment crisis besides helping the next government begin its much vaunted process of economic reform. With Chandra Shekhar’s resignation in March 1991, the Lok Sabha was dissolved and fresh elections announced. President Venkataraman asked Chandra Shekhar to continue as caretaker prime minister till June when the new government would take over. Ele

ctions of 1991 The first phase of the General Elections took place in May. Then, on the night of May 21, tragedy struck: Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated while campaigning in Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu. The next phas

ress was the largest party with 244 seats, which, however, did not reach the level of a simple majority in the House. The BJP improved upon its earlier tally creditably. The Narasimha Rao Years (June 1991 – May 1996) Pamulaparti Venkata (P.V.) Narasimha Rao was chosen to lead the Congress (I) after Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated. Narasimha Rao was an erudite scholar and knew several languages, and he w

rs, defence, human resources, and home—in the governments of Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi. After the elections, he formed a minority government. Narasimha Rao himself had not contested elections in 1991, probably with the intention of retiring from politics. But after he was sworn in as prime minister, he won in a by-election from Nandyal in Andhra Pradesh to become a member of the Lok Sabha. Rao is

The New Economic Policy of 1991 aimed at correcting the weaknesses on the fiscal and balance of payments fronts to stabilise the economy. On the structural reform side, the policy sought to remove the rigidities that infested the v

The Industrial Policy of 1991 was revolutionary for the times. Significantly, Narasimha Rao himself held the industries portfolio. The industrial licensing system was made applicable to a much shortened list of environmentally se

owed to invest in insurance, banking, telecom, and air travel sectors. The Rao government abolished the Controller of Capital Issues which governed capital issues in India; introduced the SEBI Act of 1992 and the Security Laws (Amendment) to regulate all security market intermediaries; and started the National Stock Exchange as a computer-based trading system. The system may not have been wholly refor

 Handling Security Issues and Space Tech The Punjab situation was controlled. Rao went in for state elections though there were misgivings.

India’s relations with the US gradually improved.

important part of the economic and security dynamics of the region. Significantly, the policy was taken up by governments that came after Narasimha Rao’s. Rao’s overture to China, which he visited in 1993, and Iran were useful when Pakistan brought a resolution on India’s violation of human rights in Kashmir in the human rights body of the UN: China and Iran did not favour it.  

 Negative Aspects There were two main criticisms against Narasimha Rao. One was that he allowed the Babri Masjid demolition and the other was corruption. The Babri Masjid Demolition In the late 1980s, the Bharatiya Janata Party had raked up the issue of the Ram Janmabhoomi to its advantage in the 1991 elections. The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) was even more vociferous and aggressive on the issue

uilding at the site earlier itself, but the administration took no notice. Uttar Pradesh was under BJP rule, and the chief minister at the time was Kalyan Singh. The VHP announced that on December 6, 1992, work on the temple would begin. Thousands of volunteers—the kar sevaks—converged on Ayodhya. While the plan announced was that prayers would be held on a platform near the mosque, when the time came

re arrested. Communal riots broke out in Uttar Pradesh and many other parts of the country resulting in many deaths. Bombay was one of the worst sufferers, with the Shiv Sena stoking the violence. In 1993, there were bomb blasts in the city at strategic locations orchestrated by a couple of mafia dons based in Dubai, apparently in retaliation for the attacks on Muslims earlier.  

, a sitting judge of the Punjab and Haryana High Court, was assigned the task of probing the sequence of events that led to the occurrences at the Ram Janmabhoomi- Babri Masjid complex on December 6, 1992, resulting in the destruction of the structure. The commission submitted its report some 17 years later in June 2009 when the UPA was in the government. The commission indicted top BJP leaders, and h

fied the Kalyan Singh-led BJP government in Uttar Pradesh as the key to the execution of the conspiracy to demolish Babri Masjid. The report of the commission apparently contained no criticism of the 1992 Indian government and then Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao. It accepted Rao’s contention that it was not possible to legally and constitutionally impose president’s rule in Uttar Pradesh in Decembe

r 1992 before the event. Corruption Scandals Till July 1993, the Narasimha Rao government ran smoothly though technically it was a minority government. But in July 1993, the opposition decided to test the strength of the government and brought in a no-confidence motion. The government side on its own did not have the numbers to pass the test. When the no-confidence

In 1996, after Rao was no longer prime minister, investigations in the case took place. A special court convicted Rao and his colleague, Buta Singh (who is alleged to have taken the MPs to the prime minister

l to a higher court, the decision was overturned, mainly due to the doubt attached to the credibility of Mahato who said he had taken the bribe. Both Rao and Buta Singh were cleared of the charges in 2002. Rao’s name was also dragged into the Harshad Mehta stock market scam and then in the hawala and Lakhubhai cheating cases. Rao was cleared in both cases. Rao may not have been convicted in any of the

iff of corruption never faded. Kashmir Even as Hindu religious feelings were being whipped up in India by certain groups, there was growing Islamic fundamentalism in the Kashmir valley. It was in the 1980s and the 1990s that militancy grew with the active help of Pakistan. Religious sentiment was intensified and linked to  

hol besides compelling women to wear the burqa. The Pandits bore the brunt of the actions of the militants: they were forced to leave their homes and Kashmir and become refugees. General Elections of 1996 In May 1996, Narasimha Rao resigned following the resounding defeat of the Congress in the General Elections. He also resigned from the post of party chief later. The elections were fought along thre

the BJP group get a total 187 seats. The Congress got the second position, while the National Front composed of Janata Dal, Telugu Desam, and Left Front won 114 seats. Another feature that marked the 1996 general elections was that several strong regional and state parties showed no interest in allying with any of the three main contenders for power. Rise of the Dalit Voice Even as political parties w

But alongside, as far back as in the 1970s, Kanshi Ram, having quit his government job, had mobilised Dalit government employees into an organisation— the All India Backward and Minority Communities Employees Federation (BAMCEF). This organi

t the BSP presented—that the Congress was merely using them as vote banks whereas the BSP stood for social justice and change that would take the Dalits along the path of progress. The BSP fought the 1984 elections but won no seat though it got quite a few votes. In the Uttar Pradesh state elections, it made an impressive showing. In 1993, the party won more than 60 seats, mostly drawing away votes fr

d the BJP. Mayawati, a protégé of Kanshi Ram, succeeded him as the leader of the BSP. She was the one who built up alliances with other caste groups and political parties. She won a Lok Sabha seat in 1989. In 1995, In June 1995, she created history by becoming the first-ever Dalit woman in India to serve as the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh. Though her term in office was short, in later years she wa

s to come back as chief minister of the state. In 2007, she became chief minister, and this time she stayed in that post till 2012. Between 1996 and 1999: Three Prime Ministers Now began a period of quick change of governments; the period 1996–1999 saw three prime ministers at the helm. The BJP won its largest tally so far in the 1996  

try and form a government. Atal Bihari Vajpayee, leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party, was elected the new Prime Minister of India, replacing P.V. Narasimha Rao of the Indian National Congress in May 1996. However, the party just found no allies to support it, and Vajpayee resigned after just 13 days later rather than lose a confidence vote in the House. The Congress, as the second largest party, decl

som Gana Parishad, and led by Deve Gowda, formed the government with outside support extended by the Congress party. The Communists later joined the government. The government, however, fell in April 1997 when the Congress party withdrew its support. During its short tenure, the government signed an agreement on confidence-building measures with China and the Ganga water accord with Bangladesh. The go

vernment maintained its refusal to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. The government, however, fell in April 1997 when the Congress party withdrew its support. A compromise was reached so as to avoid elections: the Congress agreed to support a government led by a new leader. The United Front elected I. K. Gujral

 as the new leader, and he was sworn in as prime minister on April 21, 1997.  

in the face of demands from within and outside the United Front. Gujral personally told him to resign. In the end, Lalu Yadav left the party and formed his own party, the Rashtriya Janata Dal in July 1997. However, as the new party extended its support to the United Front, the government did not fall. The Gujral government took a controversial decision when it recommended to the president that preside

se, and the Congress demanded that the prime minister dismiss the DMK ministers from his government. Gujral refused and the Congress party finally withdrew support from the government on November 28. 1997. Gujral resigned as a result, though he continued to be caretaker prime minister till the next government took over. General Elections Fresh elections were held in February–March, 1998. Sonia Gandhi,

 Rajiv Gandhi’s widow, entered the political fray and campaigned for the Congress. It was the fourth time since 1989 when a parliamentary election yielded a ‘hung’ house, indicating that the era of coalitions had become established. The BJP once again came ahead of the other parties though without a majority of its

nal parties from Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Orissa (now Odisha), and West Bengal. This enabled it to increase its tally of seats, besides attracting new post-poll allies. NDA Years (March 1998 – October 1999) After the elections of 1998, the BJP joined up with several regional parties to stake its chance to form the government. The group became known as the National Democratic Alliance (ND

A). Atal Bihari Vajpayee of the BJP was chosen to lead the NDA, and in March 1998, he was sworn in as prime minister, for the second time. The NDA proved its majority in the Lok Sabha. The government lasted till April 1999 when the AIADMK withdrew from the NDA. In a dramatic nocon

fidence motion in the Lok Sabha on April 17, 1999, the government lost by a single vote. This loss is generally  

MP. With the Opposition not able to come up with an alternative to form the new government, the Lok Sabha was dissolved by President K.R. Narayanan, and fresh elections were held in September–October 1999. Vajpayee remained caretaker prime minister till the elections. In the meanwhile, Sharad Pawar and some leaders left the Congress when the party chose Sonia Gandhi as its head. The few months the Vaj

payee government was in power were marked by some notable events. Pokhran II: Operation Shakti In May 1998, a series of five nuclear explosions was conducted by India at the Indian Army’s Pokhran Test Range. This was the second time, the first time being in 1974, that such devices were being tested. Terme

nn Amendment for the first time. Newer sanctions were imposed, and at one point it looked that relations would never recover. Pakistan reacted with its own nuclear tests, Chagai I and II, also in May 1998, as if it were responding in kind to India. In June, the UN Security Council adopted a resolution condemning the Indian and Pakistani tests.  

 The Lahore Summit In late 1998 and early 1999, Vajpayee worked towards a diplomatic peace process with Pakistan. The Delhi-Lahore bus service was inaugurated in February 1999, and Prime Minister Vajpayee travelled to Lahore by the bus. An attempt was made by Vajpayee now to begin a new peace process between India and Pakistan so as to permanently resolve the Kashmir dispu

te and other conflicts. At a summit at Lahore in February 1999, Prime Minister Vajpayee of India and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan signed the Lahore Declaration, espousing a commitment to dialogue, expansion of trade relations and mutual friendship, un

me minister was only told after the plan was under way. The Kargil district was the main centre of this incursion. The Indian Army first came to know of the incursion from a group of shepherds in May 1999. Swift action was taken to counter the Pakistani infiltration. Both army and the air force (with its operation called ‘Safed Sagar’) were coordinated in their action. (But the military were told clea

er 500 of the soldiers were killed. The Kargil victory boosted the image of Vajpayee as a decisive and sensible leader and also enthused the public with patriotic feelings. NDA: Second Stint (October 1999 – May 2004) The Kargil war was fresh in the public mind when the country went to the polls in 1999. There was public support for the NDA and the prime minister, in particular. The election results ga

e NDA led by the BJP a majority with the support of new constituents such as the Janata Dal (United) and the DMK. Atal Bihari Vajpayee was sworn in as prime minister for the third time on October 13, 1999. Economic and Social Steps The NDA government carried forward the economic reforms that had been initiated by the Narasimha Rao government. Infrastructure development got special attention and encour

orts were made to encourage foreign investment, especially from Europe and the United States. The government was instrumental in getting through the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act in 2003 to institutionalise financial discipline, reduce India’s fiscal deficit, improve macroeconomic management and the overall management of the public funds by moving towards a balanced budget and streng

nce. The government tried to spread education through the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan for achieving universalisation of primary education. A highlight of the period was the Constitution 86th Amendment Act, 2002, which placed the right to education among the Fundamental Rights in Part-III of the Constitution. Terrorist Trouble and Relations with Pakistan In December 1999, an Indian Airlines flight (IC 814 fr

 the Indian government as to why the external affairs minister personally escorted the terrorists to Afghanistan to exchange them for the passengers. Relations with Pakistan dipped. But again in July 2001, Vajpayee made an effort to improve relations with Pakistan by inviting Pakistan’s President Pervez Musharraf to Delhi and Agra for a summit and peace talks. No breakthrough was possible as Musharraf

 Then, in December 2001, came the attack on the Parliament House in Delhi, which was carried out by Lashkare- Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists. Once again Indo- Pakistani relations dipped. Following this attack and oth

mproved relations with President Clinton coming on a visit to India and efforts were made to expand trade and cooperation on strategic issues. Kashmir Elections Kashmir went to elections in September 2002, which were firmly made free and fair with the Election Commission making its effort in that direction. Despite militants threatening the people and telling them to boycott the elections, large numbe

The National Conference which was in power was voted out. An alliance of the Congress and Peoples Democratic Party was voted to power. Mufti Mohammad Sayeed became the chief minister. The Downside In 2001, the defence minister, George Fernandes, was forced to resign following the Barak Missile Deal scandal and another scandal involving the supplies of coffins for the soldiers killed in Kargil. There w

parently accepting a bribe which was videoed and telecast—one of the first sting operations by the media. The Godhra incident and the riots that followed put a blot on the image of India. In February 2002, the Sabarmati Express caught fire at Godhra (in Gujarat) and several pilgrims returning from Ayodhya were killed. It was widely believed that a mob of Muslims had set fire to the compartments, where

e. Riots followed, with Ahmedabad and Baroda being chiefly affected. The riots have been called a pogrom as Muslims were targeted and the violence was unbelievable. It recalled the anti-Sikh riots of 1984. Narendra Modi, who was chief minister of Gujarat at the time, was severely criticised for being unable or unwilling to control the situation. It is believed that Prime Minister Vajpayee was deeply d

 available to the Congress at the national level. And this was necessary in a truly democratic State. Some of the programmes it launched were noteworthy. Its freeing the economy further helped India. 2004 General Election The Lok Sabha term was to end in October 2004, but the government decided on early polls; the Lok Sabha was dissolved in February itself and the country went to polls in April–May 20

 The UPA Years (May 2004 – May 2009; May 2009 – May 2014) After the elections, the Congress joined up with minor parties to form the United Progressive Alliance (UPA), which managed more numbers than the NDA. President Abdul Kalam called the UPA to form th

rson. UPA Government: First Term Manmohan Singh, former finance minister, who had initiated the economic reforms when in Narasimha Rao’s government, was sworn in as Prime Minister of India on May 22, 2004. He was a member of the Rajya Sabha. A common minimum programme (CMP) was formulated to guide the policies of the UPA government. As the communist parties had an important role in devising this CMP, 

 The National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA)—to which the name of Mahatma Gandhi was added later to become MNREGA—was the largest welfare scheme of its kind in the world; it was started in 2006. It guaranteed rural households 100 days of paid labour in a year, with the aim of tackling rural poverty. The programme also sought to help women with one-third of the work mandated for women. In 20

05, the government’s health ministry started the National Rural Health Mission. Under the provisions of the Right to Information Act of 2005, any citizen of India may request information from a ‘public authority’ which is required to reply expeditiously or within thirty days. The act also requires every public authority to computerise the

ir records for wide dissemination of certain categories of information so that citizens do not have to formally request for information. In 2005, Manmohan Singh’s government introduced VAT (value added tax) to replace the complicated sales tax. Foreign Relations The Manmohan Singh government made efforts for stronger ties with the United Stat

es. The prime minister visited the US in July 2005 to initiate negotiations over the Indo-US civilian nuclear agreement. When, in 2006, President George W. Bush visited India, the declaration over the nuclear agreement was made. This gave India access to American nuclear fuel and technology, though in return India would have to allo

w its civil nuclear reactors to be inspected by the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency). It was only in October 2008 that India and the US finally signed the agreement after further negotiations and approval from the IAEA, the Nuclear Suppliers Group, and the US Congress. With this agreement, the thirty-year-long b

 July 2008, the UPA government faced a confidence vote over the issue, as the Left parties withdrew support to the government. The government managed to win the trust vote. Manmohan Singh tried to ease relation

s between India and the People’s Republic of China. In 2006, China’s President Hu Jintao visited India, and in 2008, the Indian prime minister visited Beijing. In the process, the Nathula Pass was reopened in 2006 after having been closed for more than four decades. New President In the meanwhile, in 2007, Pratibh

Governor of Rajasthan, and a close associate of the Nehru-Gandhi family. She was favoured by Sonia Gandhi as a candidate for the president’s post. Terror Attacks India faced several terror attacks in 2007–08. Even as terrorist acts were carried out by Islamic groups, there were also a number of bomb attacks in which the ostensible targets were Muslims, investigations into which pointed to the role of 

Hindu groups and individuals. In 2006, a series of explosions occurred at a Muslim cemetery in Malegaon, in Maharashtra. In May 2007, a blast took place in the Mecca Masjid in Hyderabad, then in Andhra Pradesh. In 2007, a bomb exploded at the Ajmer Dargah in Rajasthan. These blasts claimed many lives. In February 2007, a blast on 

tion on the Indian side. Many Pakistanis were killed as well as some Indians. Initially, it was reported that the main suspects in the terrorist act were the Lashkar-e- Toiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed. In 2009, the United States Treasury and the United Nations Security Council put in place sanctions on Lashkar-e-Toiba, and Arif Qasmani was named for having had a part in the Samjhauta Express bombing.  

 However, in 2011, the National Investigation Agency (NIA), established after the NIA Bill was passed in December 2008 following the Mumbai terror attacks, accused eight people of involvement in the Samjhauta blasts. These were all Hindus with extremist views who were, said the NIA, “angry with attacks on Hindu templ

es by jihadi terrorist activities”. They included Naba Kumar Sarkar, alias Swami Aseemanand, Lokesh Sharma, Kamal Chauhan, and Rajinder Chaudhary among others. [In March 2019, however, the four were acquitted by the NIA court citing lack of evidence.] There was a series of bomb blasts in 2008 in Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan. In September 2008, bombs were set off in a 

busy marketplace in Delhi. These acts of terrorism were carried out by Islamic fundamentalists often aided by Pakistan. The worst incident was the attack on November 26, 2008, perpetrated by Pakistani terrorists when a group of these young men went through Mumbai and created havoc. They entered the prestigious Taj hotel and held the guests hostage before killing many. The

orists were killed and one, Ajmal Amir Kasab, was captured. The captive’s confession confirmed that Pakistan and, more particularly, the Lashkar-e-Toiba, had masterminded the attack. [On November 11, 2012, a special court issued Kasab’s death warrant after a trial. He was hanged to death after being held guilty of 80 offences, including waging war against India.] Situation in States Before the country

 Muslims and not confined itself to the Dalits. After a long time, the state was free of a coalition government. This brought stability to the state. In May 2008, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) made an inroad in the South for the first time, forming the government in the state of Karnataka. In Jammu and Kashmir, the National Conference emerged with the larg

med a government, with the Congress joining as a junior coalition partner. In Gujarat, Chattisgarh, and Madhya Pradesh, the BJP was in power. Trouble in Kashmir Kashmir witnessed unrest once again in 2008. When it was decided to allot some forest land for shelters for pilgrims to Amarnath, there were protests in the Valley. There were counter-protests in Jammu, which was dominated by Hindus. Several p

eople were killed in police firing. The series of protests and counter-protests subsided for a time in the winter before a fresh series or protests erupted in 2010, this time over a youth killed in police firing. A large number of people, mostly the young, came out on the streets and they resorted to throwing stones and rocks at the police. The army was called 

uenced by the fundamentalists even as the central government would not even think of withdrawing the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) from the state. The Kashmir situation continues to simmer. 2009 Election and UPA Back in Power The country went to the polls in April–May 2009 to elect the 15th Lok Sabha. Posters for the Congress campaign showed three faces: those of Manmohan Singh, Sonia Gandhi

 (party president), and her son, Rahul Gandhi (who had become general secretary of the party in 2007), confirming the hold  

 as the prime minister on May 22; as per norms, he had submitted his resignation on May 18 to President Pratibha Patil. Manmohan Singh, thus, became the first prime minister since Jawaharlal Nehru in 1962 to be re-elected after completing a full term. Telangana Issue The second term of the UPA government was marked by the agitation for a separate state for Telangana. Before the 2004 elections, the Con

th the Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) and promised to create a separate state of Telangana out of Andhra Pradesh if it came to power at the Centre. The Congress did very well in Andhra Pradesh in the 2009 elections, but the chief architect of that victory, Y.S.R. Reddy, who was the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, was totally opposed to the bifurcation of the state. In the circumstances, the Congress

was strongly opposed to the idea.] Y.S.R. Reddy died in an air crash, and the agitation for Telangana got a fresh lease of life, with the movement being led by K. Chandrasekhar Rao (KCR). In November 2009, KCR went on a fast unto death in the cause of Telangana as a separate state; life in Hyderabad was badly disrupted, with KCR’s supporters coming out in thousands to protest. The government at the Ce

ntre gave in and, in December 2009, announced that the process to form the state was being initiated. The decision caused much resentment among the Congress MPs from coastal Andhra, but it had to be accepted in the end. The Centre app

ointed a commission headed by a retired judge of the Supreme Court, B.N. Srikrishna, to look into the matter of bifurcation. The commission submitted its report in December 2010, but it was rejected by the TRS. After much negotiation, Parliament cleared the Telangana Bill in February 2014. As per the act, Andhra Pradesh was formally divided to form the new state of Telangana

. While the two states were to share Hyderabad as capital for ten years, the Centre was to provide funds to Andhra Pradesh (also Seemandhra) to build a new capital. [It was only in June 2014, after a new government took over at the Centre, that Telangana actually came into existence, with KCR as the chief minister.] Incidentally, in May 2011, there was a historic development on the state

 government level. West Bengal, where the Left Front had ruled without break since 1977 (itself constituting a record), decided to switch allegiance, and put the Trinamool Congress (TMC) in power. Mamata Banerjee, who had once been in the Congress but had broken away to form and lead th

 to Free and Compulsory Education Act, known as the RTE Act, came into being in 2009. The Constitution (Eighty-sixth Amendment) Act, 2002 had already inserted Article 21-A in the Constitution of India to provide free and compulsory education to all children in the age group of six to fourteen years as a Fundamental Right in such a mann

er as the State may, by law, determine. The RTE Act, 2009 put in place what is envisaged under Article 21-A; it means that every child has a right to full-time elementary education of satisfactory and equitable quality in a formal school, which satisfies ce

random selection. These children are to be treated on par with other children in the school, but they will be subsidised by the State. Article 21-A along with the RTE Act came into effect on April 1, 2010. An attempt was made to get the bill on reserving 33 per cent of seats in the union and state legislatures passed; the bill was introduced in the Rajya Sabha, but the government was compelled to shel

ve it as its own allies, especially the Rashtriya Janata Dal, refused to support it. The government was, in a way, forced to formulate the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013 to deal with sexual offences against women. One night in December 2012, a horrific gang rape of a young woman took place in Delhi. Jyoti Singh, accompanied by her friend, got on to a private bus, whi

‘Nirbhaya’ in the media as the real name of the rape victim could not be published. (Her real name was later revealed openly by her mother.) The police were quick to arrest the six culprits. In March 2014, the Delhi High Court found all the defendants guilty of rape, murder, unnatural offences, and destruction of evidence. The high court confirmed death sentence for all four men convicted earlier. (Th

e juvenile was tried under a different law and escaped with a few years in prison, and one of the accused died in jail.) The case went in appeal to the Supreme Court. [It was not till 2018 that the case was finally settled. In May 2017, the Supreme Court rejected the convicts’ appeal and upheld the death sentence of the four who had been charged in the murder. The convicts exercised th

eir right to file a review petition to the Supreme Court, but the Supreme Court rejected the review petition in July 2018.] The gang rape incident led to widespread protests in Delhi and in many other places in India, in spite of the police arresting the culprits quickly. (Incidentally, the protests in India sparked pro

 and clashed with the security forces. The government was initially high-handed, but ultimately it was forced to climb down. The government appointed a three-member judicial committee on December 22, 2012. It was headed by J.S. Verma, a former Chief Justice of India and an eminent jurist, and was asked to recommend amendments to the criminal law so as to provide for quicker trial and greater punishmen

t for criminals accused of committing sexual assault against women. In its report, submitted in January 2013, the committee was critical of the government, the police, and even the public  

isance by the court should be sufficient for disqualification of a candidate. The committee wanted education facilities to be provided by the State to the homeless and abandoned children. In February 2013, the government promulgated an ordinance amending the Indian Penal Code, the Indian Evidence Act, the Code of Criminal Procedure, and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act in matters re

lating to sexual offences. In March 2013, the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act was passed by Parliament to replace the ordinance. Several new sections were inserted in the existing laws to define and bring within the ambit of law such offences 

d mainly for not bringing marital rape within its ambit, and for doing away with gender neutrality in the cases of sexual offences and rape because it recognises these offences only against women. In 2013, the government pushed through the National Food Security Act and the Right to Food Act. This was aimed at providing subsidised food grains to the beneficiaries of the targeted public distribution sy

ies with those of the NAC. Space Venture to Mars Amidst all the negative aspects that occupied the political discussion, it was heartening to watch the success of Indian space scientists. In November 2013, the first interplanetary mission of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), officially called the Mars Orbiter Mission and popularly known as Mangalyaan, was launched. [On September 24, 2014,

ttempt, and at a remarkably low cost.] Corruption Charges and Lokpal Act The UPA government in its second term could also be credited with having got the Lokpal and Lokayuktas bill passed in December 2013. But here too it was compelled by circumstances to do so. The second term of the UPA government was fraught with allegations of corruption against it. There was a controversy over the allocation of t

he 2G and 3G spectrum (telecom licences), which were alleged to have been given away at very low rates. In 2010, the Comptroller and Auditor General’s report seemed to confirm this. Then came the Commonwealth Games scandal, with reports of huge sums of money changing hands for the procurement of contracts for 

 Commonwealth Games scam led to a Congress minister. The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General in 2012 charged that coal block allocations had led to a loss to the exchequer because the allocations were based on favouritism; this report actually cast an aspersion on Manmohan Singh’s reputation, which 

had always been that of a clean politician, as the allocations had been made when the coal portfolio was with him (2006–09). The corruption stories were extensively covered and debated on the numerous television channels and brought the subject to a large number of people. Anti-corruption movements became prominent in

 2011. Anna Hazare, a well-known social worker from Ralegaon Siddhi village in Maharashtra, came to Delhi in April 2011 and sat on a 12-day fast to protest against the corruption in government and the failure to tighten anti-corruption legislation. His specific demand was that a Lokpal be established. Many activists j

ublic life–lawyers, civil servants, and academicians. Large numbers of people, including celebrities, came out to support Anna Hazare. And the media coverage added to the importance of the event. The 2011 movement was significant in Indian political history in that it provided people the opportunity to express frustration. Most people had experience of having had to bribe officials and politicians for

 in the protest. The government came down hard on the protestors after its efforts at conciliation failed. Ramdev was ordered to stay out of Delhi. The Lokpal Bill, approved by the government in July 2011, was rejected by the activists on the ground that it excluded several high functionaries from the ambit of the lokpal’s jurisdiction. Anna Hazare declared that he would once again go on a fast in the

ost protesters unwilling to let political parties make use of them in pushing political agendas. The movement was nowhere near Jaya Prakash Narayan’s ‘Sampurna Kranti’ (total revolution) agitation of 1974–77. The difference was that the protest in 2011 was held in full media glare; after all, the era of the 24×7 television had arrived. The government failed in its efforts to move Anna Hazare from his 

e of the protesters were not ready to enter the political arena. However, Arvind Kejriwal was in favour of entering politics. Kejriwal and some others formed the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on November 26, 2012. It was going to create history by getting a stupendous majority in the Delhi Assembly elections of 2015, decimating the Congress and reducing the BJP to a few seats. The Lokpal and Lokayuktas Bill w

as first tabled in the Lok Sabha in December 2011 and, after being passed, was tabled in the Rajya Sabha in the same month. The vote failed to take place after a marathon debate. In May 2012, the bill was referred to a select committee of the Rajya Sabha. In December 2013, it was passed by both the Houses of Parliament. On January 1, 2014, it received assent from President Pranab Mukherj

ee (who had been elected President of India in 2012). The Lokpal and Lokayukta Act, 2013 mandates the establishment of Lokpal for the Union and Lokayukta for states to enquire into allegations of corruption against certain public functionaries and for related matters. The act extends to 

Lokpal was not made a constitutional body; and the judiciary was excluded from the ambit of the Lokpal. Conditions Before General Election When the country went to the general elections in April– May 2014, much of the positive achievements of the UPA in its second term was relegated to the background, while the corruption allegations remained in most people’s minds. The rural sector faced problems. Fa

ers committed suicide on a large scale, mainly due to indebtedness, crop failure, drought, and socio-economic factors. Farmer distress did not seem to have come down even though the UPA government in 2008 had announced a loan waiver of Rs 70,000 crore. The UPA government rolled out several socio-economic programmes, but their implementation was poor in most cases. There was also dissatisfaction on a m

d many progressive economic ideas remained on paper. The fiscal deficit and a sharp downslide of the rupee led to instability in the economy. It did not seem as if the UPA was coming back to power in 2014. The 2014 General Election The 2014 General Election, according to many analysts, was fought as if it were a presidential election. However, most of the elections to the Lok Sabha down the years have

 the party won, would be the prime minister. Manmohan Singh had clearly stated that he was not ready to be prime minister again. Rahul Gandhi had been appointed vice-president of his party in January 2013, reinforcing the perception that the party followed the dynastic path and was full of sycophants. The BJP, on the other hand, did have a more credible party structure in place: party decisions were b

odi’s firm commitment to development, industrialisation, and job creation appealed to the young and inspired hope in the public. The country went to the polls to elect the 16th Lok Sabha in April–May 2014. When the votes were counted, the BJP emerged with a majority on its own, with 282 seats. The Congress won just 44 seats, its worst performance in elections so far. The BJP showed remarkable success 

in most states; the exceptions were West Bengal, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala. Its vote share on all-India basis increased from about 19 per cent to about 31 per cent. The NDA Government (May 2014 –May 2019) Though the BJP had a majority on its own, it did not ignore its allies; it was the NDA that formed the government on May 26, 2014. Narendra Modi took his oath as prime minister along with 

perwork involved in the public-government interface and thereby lowering the corruption levels, the Modi government launched the Digital India campaign within three months of taking office, in August 2014. The success of several socio-economic and governance programmes, existing as well as intended to be launched, depended upon the efficacy of Digital India. The idea was to electronically empower the 

 the NITI (National Institution for Transforming India) Aayog. The Independent Evaluation Office submitted an assessment report to Prime Minister Modi on May 29, 2014, recommending that the Planning Commission be replaced with a ‘control commission’. The union cabinet scrapped the Planning Commission in August 2014. On January 1, 2015, after a cabinet resolution w

he reform was to directly transfer subsidy to the beneficiary. The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana was announced by the prime minister in his Independence Day speech, and it was launched on August 24, 2014. It was one of the largest schemes in the world for financial inclusion, directed towards helping those persons so far without a bank account to open a bank account (without minimum balance requireme

y and security are affected need to be addressed, but the advantages of the poor getting access to modern finance cannot be denied. A tool for identity mapping that was launched by the UPA in January 2009, Aadhaar was strengthened and institutionalised by the new government. The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) was established as a central government agency with the objective of collec

ng the delivery of services to the citizens. The NDA government managed to get Parliament to enact the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act in March 2016. The Centre began identifying the recipients of the LPG subsidy by insisting that consumers link their gas connections and bank accounts to their Aadhaar. Though the Supreme Court restricted the use 

 the taxpayer would go down. Moreover, with lower subsidies and fiscal deficit, India’s international credit standing would improve. Health Policy A new National Health Policy was launched in January 2015. Government spending was not increased; instead, the role of private healthcare organisations was emphasised. In this, the Modi government showed a different path from that of the UPA government, whi

 public health goals. Several national health programmes, including those aimed at controlling tobacco use and supporting health care for the elderly, were merged with the National Health Mission. In 2018, the Ayushman Bharat programme, a government health insurance scheme, was launched. On October 2, 2014 was launched the Swachh Bharat Mission (Clean India Mission), Prime Minister Modi’s flagship san

 cities, towns, and rural areas, and doing away with manual scavenging. The main aim was to make the country free of open defecation to which purpose government encouraged the building of toilets. In 2018, the World Health Organisation said thousands of deaths from diarrhoea were averted in rural India after the launch of the sanitation mission. Steps Directed Towards Economic Reform The Modi governme

ll aware that the job situation was not good and that India’s demographic dividend could rapidly turn from an asset to a liability, the Modi government initiated the Make in India scheme in September 2014. It was a flagship programme to boost the domestic manufacturing industry and attract foreign investment in the Indian economy. Along with it, many other programmes were also put in place, such as St

 Up India, Stand Up India, Skill India, and so on. The success of these programmes was not up to expectations, but they did make some progress. Parliament amended the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 to expedite the arbitration of commercial disputes. The amended law tackled issues of conflicts of interest and brought disclosures by arbitrators into the ambit of the law. Time limit was set on the

 arbitration procedure. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code was a new law enacted in 2016 to consolidate the existing laws related to insolvency in India and to simplify the process of insolvency resolution so as to enable easy exit in cases of insolvency of individuals and companies. Thi

s law replaced several overlapping provisions contained in various laws, such as the Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 1985, the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993, the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 (also known as the S

arfaesi Act), and the Companies Act, 2013, among others. With the new law in place, banks and other creditors could hope to recover their loans from the bankrupt companies in a time-bound and efficient way, entrepreneurship could be promoted

 of 2016 tightened the law in the use of unaccounted, taxevaded money for what is known as ‘benami’ transactions through the purchase of property. Under the amended law, authorities were empowered to provisio

nally attach and eventually confiscate benami properties. Jail terms of between one and seven years and a fine are prescribed for offenders. The Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act of 2016 was another policy initiative of the NDA government. As per the law, a regulator—the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA)—was to be established in every state to oversee the sector and “protect th

estate project to be registered with its state’s RERA. Unfortunately, this law required to be enforced by state governments. The Fugitive Economic Offenders Act (FEOA), which came into force in April 2018, was required to tackle the large fraud cases reported by banks. Under the law, if an economic offender flees the country to avoid due process, he/she can be declared a ‘fugitive economic offender’ a

nd their properties can be confiscated and auctioned to recover at least part of the debt. The government adopted the Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy (HELP) in 2016, with the major guiding principles of enhancing domestic oil and gas production; bringing substantial investment; generating sizeable employment; enhancing transparency; and reducing administrative d

and price the crude oil and natural gas produced (subject to a ceiling price). This policy was in keeping with government’s stated intention of ‘Minimum Government Maximum Governance’. On November 8, 2016, a controversial and the most criticised step of the Modi government was taken when the prime minister in a sudden address to the nation announced that the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes would ce

tched over to e-commerce payment systems. The Modi government tried to bring in black money through several schemes, none of which were amnesty schemes. One was the Income Declaration Scheme (IDS) in 2016. The other option was the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY) launched in December 2016 after demonetisation, which provided an opportunity to declare unaccounted wealth and black money in a c

 paying a fine of 50 per cent on the undisclosed income. Reportedly, a total 64,275 people disclosed Rs 65,250 crore under the IDS, while assets worth Rs 5,000 crore were declared under the PMGKY. In 2015, the government had enacted the Black Money (Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets) and Imposition of Tax Act under which the government provided a one-time window for compliance. It is doubtful if d

emonetisation had an adverse effect on the BJP politically. In elections to state assemblies held in 2017, the BJP and its allies won the required majorities to form the government in six out of seven state legislative assemblies, and among these was the most populous state of Uttar Pradesh. The biggest 

T). It overhauled the Centre-state financial relations in a major way. The move towards GST began long ago, but was expressed by the then union finance minister under the UPA in his budget speech for 2006–07. At the time, the proposal was opposed by many political parties, including the BJP. The government then could not push it through. The NDA government achieved something noteworthy in getting the 

 to be the biggest tax reform since independence. It was in 2016 that the Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment) Act could be enacted after duly being ratified by the required number of states, after which the GST could be launched. It changed the system o

years after independence, Indian agriculture still depended on monsoons and proved to be a gamble. The Narendra Modi government had declared its intention of doubling farmers’ income in real terms by 2022, moving away from the historical focus on increasing production. New crop insurance scheme and higher funding for irrigation to counter weather risks were announced by the NDA government. Several sch

 subject of agriculture is a state subject, reforms needed to be endorsed by the states. The APMC Act could not be reformed. The government agreed to the demand for a higher minimum support price. In 2019, it announced the central sector scheme, ‘Pradhan Mantri KIsan SAmman Nidhi (PMKISAN)’. The aim was to supplement the financial needs of the farmers in procuring various inputs to ensure proper crop 

health and appropriate yields, commensurate with the anticipated farm income. This followed the announcement in the interim budget of February 2019 that farmers with less than five acres each, who account for over 85 per cent of India’s farm holdings, would get Rs 6,000 each annually. Over the years, India became self-sufficient in food grains, 

f rural houses built increased considerably, with several beneficiaries getting their due. There was also a large push on rural electrification to ensure all villages had an electricity connection by 2018 under the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana. Under the Ujjwala Yojana, the government aimed to provide LPG connections to below poverty line households in the country to replace polluting cookin

g fuels used in rural India with the clean and more efficient liquefied petroleum gas. The Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme was launched in 2015 with the aim of reducing the female infanticide rate by encouraging education and welfare of the girl child. Also launched in 2015 was the Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana, the primary objective of the schem

ificant progress has been made in restricting Maoists to the state’s southern districts. Improved road connectivity and better equipped and trained security forces helped to improve the situation. In 2015, the government had launched a National Policy and Action Plan for the security and development of areas affected by Naxalite/Maoist insurgency, and for improving the training and equipment of the se

curity forces. In the wake of the demonetisation drive, there was a halt in insurgent activity, as funds had, indeed been squeezed out. In May 2019, however, an IED blast was carried out by Maoists in Gadchiroli, Maharashtra. The Maoists targeted an anti-insurgency operations team. Gadchiroli and Gondia have areas contiguous with the Dandakarany

 of Pakistan. The volatile security scenario in the Indian state is a manifestation of Pakistan’s proxy war with India, combined with the unsettled political issues of the state. In November–December 2014, elections were held to elect the Jammu and Kashmir state assembly. The regional People’s Democratic Party (PDP) emerged as the single largest party but could not form a government on its own. It was

 only in February 2015 that the BJP and the PDP decided to join together to form a government. In March, the coalition government was sworn in, and for the first time, the BJP was part of a government in the state. Mufti M

ohammed Sayeed of the PDP became the chief minister. But in January 2016, Mufti Mohammed Sayeed died, and this created problems for the coalition as the mufti’s daughter and successor as head of the PDP, Mehbooba Mufti, was not keen to take the post of chief ministership 

 with the BJP. As the alliance seemed to be in a crisis, Governor’s rule was promulgated. With the problems somewhat ironed out, Mehbooba Mufti took her oath as chief minister of the state in April 2016, the first woman to hold the position in the state. Street protests started in Kashmir in July 2016 following the killing of Burhan Wani, a commander of the Hizbul Mujahideen, by security forces. Cur

an security forces, trying to control the protesters, used pellet guns, which, although considered ‘non-lethal’, caused permanent eye damage in many cases. This only worsened the situation. In August 2017, Abu Dujana, the Pakistani commander of banned terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba, and his aide Arif Nabi Dar, were killed after a gun battle with government troops in Kashmir’s Pulwama district. There wer

e violent protests over this too. Differences in the coalition government came to the fore. Ultimately, the uneasy coalition came to an end in June 2018 when the BJP pulled out of the government. The immediate cause for the break between the two parties lay in their differences over the continuation of the Ramzan ceasefire. The militants continued wi

on. The state was later placed under Governor’s rule again. In the meanwhile, terrorist attacks on Indian forces took place every now and then. The Pathankot Air Force Station was attacked in January 2016, purportedly by terrorists belonging to Jaish-e-Mohammed. On June 25, 2016, a Central Reserve Police Force convoy was ambushed en route  

 from Pantha Chowk to the town of Pampore, in Pulwama district, for which the terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba subsequently claimed responsibility. Early morning on September 18, 2016, four heavily armed persons entered the administrative block of the army camp in the Uri sector, some 100 km from Srinagar, and killed a number of soldiers. It was the most serious attack on an army 

amp in 26 years. After a gun battle, all four terrorists were killed. Jaish-e- Mohammed was suspected of being involved in the attack. India conducted surgical strikes in retaliation on September 29, 2016, against terrorist launch pads across the Line of Control in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. The Indian Army said that a number of militants were neutralised in the operation. However, this did not act as

 much of a deterrent as, on the night of October 3, 2016, terrorists fired at and lobbed grenades on a Rashtriya Rifle battalion in Baramulla. The attackers were reported to have been Pakistani nationals belonging to Jaish-e-Mohammad. The border continued 

to be tense for some time, with several attacks being perpetrated by the Pakistanis and the Indian side forced to return fire. On February 14, 2019, a convoy of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) was the target of a bomb blast when it was attacked by a vehicle-borne suicide bomber in the Pulwama district on the Jammu Srinagar Highway. The a

d have been easier to present as evidence, it said. The Balakot airstrike pushed India and Pakistan to the brink of an armed conflict. Pakistan Air Force attempted retaliatory strikes on February 27, 2019. The IAF scrambled its fighter jets in response, leading to a dogfight between the Indian and Pakistani jets in the skies over Jammu and Kashmir. An IAF MiG-21 Bison fighter jet shot down a Pakistani

It was in July 2019 that the airspace was opened. Foreign Relations India’s foreign policy did not shift drastically on the NDA government’s coming to power in 2014. However, a subtle

India is today an aligned state—but based on issues.” Sushma Swaraj, one of the senior-most leaders of BJP, was placed in charge of the external affairs ministry in 2014, becoming the first woman in India to hold independent charge of the ministry. However, the prime minister was always closely overviewing the sector. Not only Sushma Swaraj but also Prime Minister Mo

 Modi’s foreign policy was to improve relations with neighbouring countries. The government’s ‘neighbourhood diplomacy’ was successful in improving relations with Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. In 2015, the Indian parliament ratified a land exchange deal with Bangladesh in the matter of some enclaves, which had been initiated by the UPA government but left pending. But relations with Pakistan saw a

 the previous section. With China, there were glitches, but the talks between the two countries were maintained and the situation kept under control. A major stand-off between India and China came in 2017 over Doklam. Doklam is an area of some 100 square kilometres, comprising a plateau and a valley, located at the junction between India, Bhutan, and China. The Chumbi Valley of Tibet, Bhutan’s Ha Vall

ey and Sikkim surround it. In 2017, the Chinese tried to construct a road in the area, and Indian troops, called in by their Bhutanese counterparts, objected to it, resulting in the stand-off. Doklam is strategic for India as it is cl

Modi succeeded in getting the US to sign the bilateral Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement in 2016 for facilitating logistical support, supplies, and services between the militaries of the two countries. Then, in 2018, the Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA) was signed to

Earlier, India joined the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) in 2016 and the Wassenaar Arrangement (WA) in 2017. India’s membership bid for the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) was pending as China opposed India’s bid. India took a leading role in the establishment of th

The ubiquitous use of the smartphone and cheap internet connections became a common phenomenon only after 2010.

It was in 2001 that the issue of constitutional legality of Article 377 was first raised by the Naz Foundation in the Delhi High Court, which held the penal provision to be illegal in 2009, but that judgement was o

verturned by the Supreme Court in 2013. In 2018, the apex court overturned its own earlier stance. An August 2017 judgement of the Supreme Court upheld the right to privacy, and this laid the legal ground for a fresh interpretation of Article 377 in the matter of decriminalising homosexuality. However, other iss

 low levels of skills among India’s workers, available jobs being low paid, poor infrastructure, and India’s antiquated labour laws were some factors. General Election and Return of the NDA April–May 2019 saw the Indian electorate casting votes to elect the 17th Lok Sabha. The elections were held in seven phases, and the votes began to be counted on May 23. The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) got a

n overwhelming majority, winning 353 seats; the BJP on its own garnered 303 seats, a majority on its own. This was better than their performance in the 2014 elections, a feat none could have predicted. The BJP, for the first time, made striking inroads in West Bengal. Also, it did well in states which had just recently ousted the BJP in favour of the Con

elections. This reflected in the main the voters’ perspicacity: they were clear about who would be better at the state level and who they wanted at the national level. The Congress did better than in 2014 by winning 52 seats, while its other UPA allies won 33, but the picture was clear: the NDA had returned to power at the Centre. A landmark was achieved in 2019: not only did the largest number of fem

In 1908, he was sentenced to two life terms for sedition for his political activities. He was not seen as a political prisoner but was reportedly put to hard labour and even tortured.

Liaquat Hussain of Patna suggested boycott and organised the East Indian Railway strike in 1906. He also wrote fiery articles in Urdu to rouse nationalist sentiments in Muslims. He was supported by other Muslim swadeshi agitators like Ghaznavi, Rasul, Din Mohammed, Dedar Bux, Moniruzzaman, Isma

revolutionary journal Sandhya, later joining the Bengali nationalist newspaper Bande Mataram as an assistant to its editor Aurobindo Ghosh, afterwards becoming its editor. He was deported to Burma in 1908 for his political activities. Much later, he became a supporter of the non-violent methods of the Indian National Congress. Ramendra Sunder Trivedi called for observance of arandhan (keeping the hear

on each other’s wrists as a sign of brotherhood). Aurobindo Ghosh was in favour of extending the movement to the rest of India. He was appointed as the principal of Bengal National College founded in 1906 to encourage patriotic thinking and an education system related to Indian conditions and culture. He was also the editor of Bande Mataram and through his editorials encouraged strikes, national educa

itish rule, and wrote in the vernacular to spread the idea among the masses. The book proved immensely popular and served as an inspiration to the Swadeshi Movement. The government banned the book in 1910 and confiscated all the available copies but, by then, it had been read by innumerable people. Deuskar is reputed to have introduced the Shivaji festival in Bengal. The earliest modern political use 

of the word ‘swaraj’ is considered to have been by Deuskar in his pamphlet on Shivaji (1902). Sarala Devi Ghoshal (Chaudarani), daughter of Janakinath Ghoshal, one of the founding members of the Indian National Congress, was Rabindranath Tagore’s niece. A bright student, she pursued higher

Gokhale, president of the Benaras session of the Indian National Congress, 1905, supported the Swadeshi Movement. Abdul Halim Guznavi, a zamindar and a lawyer, set up swadeshi industries and helped Aurobindo Ghosh to extend revolutionary activities outside Bengal. He was assiste

The Savarkar brothers founded the Mitra Mela in 1899 and were directly involved in extremism in Maharashtra. Dinshaw Wacha persuaded mill-owners in Maharashtra to sell dhotis at moderate prices. Non-Cooperation Movement M.K. Gandhi issued a manifesto i

n March 1920, announcing his doctrine of non-violent Non-Cooperation Movement. He was the main force behind the movement and urged the people to adopt swadeshi principles and habits including hand spinning, weavi

He suspended the movement after an outburst of violence at Chauri Chaura in UP in February 1922. C.R. Das moved the main resolution on non-cooperation in the annual session of the Congress in Nagpur in 1920 and played a major role in promoting the movement. A successful lawyer, he boycotted the

 Bengali nationalist leader, supported the labourers on tea plantations in Assam in their protests and strike. Basanti Debi, wife of C.R. Das, was one of the first women volunteers to court arrest in 1921. Birendranath Sasmal organised the anti-union board agitation in the Contai and Tamluk sub-divisions of Midnapore. In November– December 1921, Samsal initiated a no-tax movement among the Mahishya su

He was arrested in 1921. Other notable lawyers who gave up their practice included M.R. Jayakar, Saifuddin Kitchlew, Vallabhbhai Patel, C. Rajagopalachari, T. Prakasam, and Asaf Ali. Their sacrifice inspired many others, wh

a Lajpat Rai was initially not in favour of the policy of non-cooperation (he was against the boycott of schools), but later he supported the movement. In fact, he protested against its withdrawal in 1922. Rajendra Prasad actively supported the Gandhian movement in Bihar. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel spread the movement in Gujarat and regarded non-cooperation as a feasible alternative to revolutionary ter

Purushottamdas Thakurdas, Jamnadas Dwarkadas, Cowasji Jehangir, Phroze Sethna, and Setalvad, all of whom belonged to the industrialist section, launched an Anti-Non-Cooperation Association in 1920. Kunjahammed Haji, Kalathingal Mammad, Ali Musaliar, Sithi Koya Thangal, and Imbichi Koya Thangal acted as presidents of the Khilafat Republics set up at a number of places. K. Madhavan Nair, U. Gopa

Kishan Singh and Mota Singh called for no-revenue movements and headed the ‘Babbar Akali’ group, which emerged as a dissident of Shiromani Gurudwara Prabhandhak Committee, in 1921 in Jullundur and Hoshiarpur. Jairamdas Daulatram was a close associate of Gandhi and promoted the Non-Cooperation Movement. Swami Govindananda, a supporter of Gandhi, was jailed for five years on cha

Dange, in April 1921, wrote Gandhi versus Lenin and was in favour of swaraj which would nationalise factories and distribute zamindari land among farmers. Thiru Vika supported the labour uprising and strike at the Buckin

He was arrested in February 1921. A. Shah Naim Ata announced himself ‘King of Salon’ and initiated no-taxes movement. M.N. Roy, a communist leader, was the editor of the communist journal Vanguard. He condemned the sessions court’s

Gandhi formally launched the Civil Disobedience Movement on April 6, 1930 by picking a handful of salt after the completion of the historic ‘Dandi March’ from Sabarmati Ashram to Dandi, thus breaking the salt law imposed by the government. He was the major force behind the

freedom struggle. C. Rajagopalachari led a salt march from Trichinopoly to Vedaranniyam on the Tanjore coast in Tamil Nadu, in support of the Civil Disobedience Movement. He was arrested on April 30, 1930. K. Kelappan, a Nair Congress leader, launched the Vaikom Satyagraha and marched from Calicut to Payanneer in defiance of salt laws. Jawaharlal Nehru was actively involved in the movement and was arr

Homi Modi, in his presidential speech to Bombay Mill-owners’ Association in March 1931 said that though the Swadeshi Movement had helped the Indian industry, frequent strikes had dislocated trade and industry. Naranji and Thakurdas, who had remained indifferent to the nationalist strug

However, from September 1930, there was a sharp decline in support from the industrialists and traders, with the prominent businessmen having differences of opinion with the Congress. Chandraprabha Saikiani instigated the aborig

Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya, who was an upholder of Gandhian policies since 1920s, began to drift away with the launch of Harijan campaign by Gandhi. He started a breakaway Congress Nationalist Party. Satyamurthi, Bhulabhai Desai, M.A. Ansari, and B.C. Roy demanded a return to el

the Indian Independence League (formed in March 1942) in June 1942. He was living in Japan since 1915 as a fugitive. He mobilised Indian soldiers taken as prisoners of war by the Japanese forces (after the British was defeated in South East Asia) for an armed rebellion against the British colonial ru
