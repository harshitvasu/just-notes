4.	Kalsi	—	Karnataka
How many pairs given above are correctly matched?

(a) Only one pair

(b) Only two pairs

(c) Only three pairs

(d) All four pairs

Ans: (b)

Explanation:

Dhauli is an important early historic urban centre of Orissa. The archaeological remains found at Dhauli traced back its antiquity to c.3rd century B.C, particularly to the time of Ashoka. Dhauli is of great historical importance as one of the famous Rock Edicts of emperor Ashoka is located here. Hence, Pair 1 is correctly matched. https://magazines.odisha.gov.in/Orissareview/july2006/engpdf/49-53.pdf 
In 2013, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) geared up for protecting the Ashoka rock edict site near Erragudi on Gooty-Pathikonda road in Kurnool district, Andhra Pradesh. Hence, Pair 2 is correctly matched. 
The inscriptions were one of the important treasures of Mouryan king Ashoka (269-231 BCE) falling under major and minor rock inscriptions. https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/asi-to-develop-ashoka-rock-site-as-tourist-spot/article4766897.ece 
Jaugada is an ancient fort that served as a Mauryan fortified capital of the Kalinga province. Jaugada is located near the cities of Berhampur and Purushottampur in Ganjam district of Odisha.
Jaugada is the second place in Odisha where there is a major Ashokan rock edict, also known as Kalinga edict. Hence, Pair 3 is not correctly matched. https://odishatourism.gov.in/content/tourism/en/blog-details.html?url=jaugada-Ashokan-major-rock-edict-in-odisha 
The Ashoka edict in Kalsi scripted the humane approach after the war when Ashoka imbibed Buddhism. Kalsi lies in the buffer zone between Uttaranchal and Himachal Pradesh. Hence, Pair 4 is not correctly matched. https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/travel/uttarakhand/kalsi/ps36300328.cms

2. Consider the following pairs:

King		Dynasty
1.	Nannuka	—	Chandela
2.	Jayashakti	—	Paramara
3.	Nagabhata II	—	Gurjara-Pratihara
4.	Bhoja	—	Rashtrakuta
How many pairs given above are correctly matched?

(a) Only one pair

(b) Only two pairs

(c) Only three pairs

(d) All four pairs

Ans: (b)

Explanation:

The Chandela or Chandel was an Indian Rajput clan of Central India. They were popularly termed as Chandelas or Jejakabhukti dynasty in Indian history. 
As per legends, contained in Mahoba Khanda, Chandela family was descended from the union of Moon (in Hindi called Chandra) and Hemavati.  
As per A954 CE Khajuraho inscriptions, first king of Chandela dynasty i.e. Nannuka was descendant of sage Chandratreya who was son of famous Vedic sage Atri. Hence, Pair 1 is correctly matched. 
https://mahoba.nic.in/history/ 



Jayashakti belonged to the Chandela dynasty and not the Paramara dynasty. Hence, Pair 2 is not correctly matched. 
https://www.khajuraho-india.org/chandela-dynasty.html

Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty, either of two dynasties of medieval Hindu India. The line of Harichandra ruled in Mandor, Marwar (Jodhpur, Rajasthan), during the 6th to 9th centuries CE, generally with feudatory status. The line of Nagabhata ruled first at Ujjain and later at Kannauj during the 8th to 11th centuries. Other Gurjara lines existed, but they did not take the surname Pratihara.
In the complicated and badly documented wars of the early 9th century—involving Pratiharas, Rashtrakutas, and Palas—Nagabhata II played an important part.
Nagabhata II became the most powerful ruler of northern India and established his new capital at Kannauj. Nagabhata II was succeeded by his son Ramabhadra in about 833. Hence, Pair 3 is correctly matched.  https://www.britannica.com/topic/Gurjara-Pratihara-dynasty 
Mihir Bhoja belonged to the Paramara dynasty. Hence, Pair 4 is not correctly matched.
https://dhar.nic.in/en/bhojshala/

Therefore, option (b) is correct.
3. Which one of the following statement about Sangam literature in ancient South India is correct?

(a) Sangam poems are devoid of any reference to material culture.

(b) The social classification of Varna was known to Sangam poets.

(c) Sangam poems have no reference to warrior ethic.

(d) Sangam literature refers to magical forces as irrational.

Ans: (b)

Explanation:

The corpus of poems known as Sangam literature was produced over six centuries, from around 300 BC to 300 AD, by Tamils from very diverse social backgrounds. 
These works provide insight into early Tamil culture and into trade relations (hence, not devoid of material culture) between South India and the Mediterranean, West Asia and Southeast Asia. 
Sangam writings are possibly unique in early Indian literature, which is almost entirely religious. The poems are concerned with two main topics: those of the first five collections are on love (akam), and those of the next two are on heroism (puram), including the praise of kings and their deeds. 
Many of the poems, especially on heroism (hence, dealing with warrior ethics), display great freshness and vigour and are singularly free from the literary conceits of much of the other early and medieval literatures of India. 
Being bardic literature in praise of heroes and patrons, its concern with various aspects of society and economy was incidental.
https://en.unesco.org/silkroad/sites/default/files/knowledge-bank-article/sangam_literature_as_a_source_of_evidence_on_indias_trade_with_the.pdf 

Sangam literature reflects a belief in sacred or magical forces called ananku that were supposed to inhabit various objects.
https://books.google.co.in/books?id=cvauDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA424&lpg=PA424&dq=SANGAM+POEMS+AND+MAGICAL+FORCES&source=bl&ots=vgEv_DYo7S&sig=ACfU3U3iYzte1ZkSPrDW9OVZGwDhc6xhAQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiMuc6A_pX4AhX4n4QIHToICOoQ6AF6BAgmEAM#v=onepage&q=SANGAM%20POEMS%20AND%20MAGICAL%20FORCES&f=false

"Sangam" literature is not the product of a particular social or religious group nor was it sponsored as a court literature by a ruling elite. 
Composed at various points of time over a long span of about 600 years and authored by people of various levels- princes, chieftains, peasants, merchants, potters, smiths, carpenters and brahmanas, Jains and Buddhists, the poems deal with disparate social groups. (hence, social classification of varna was known). https://www.britannica.com/art/shangam-literature 
Hence, option (b) is correct.

4. “Yogavasistha” was translated into Persian by Nizamuddin Panipati during the reign of:

(a) Akbar

(b) Humayun

(c) Shahjahan

(d) Aurangzeb

Ans: (a)

Explanation:

Nizamuddin Panipati translated Yoga Vasistha at the request of Jahangir in 1597. This translation was considered as a part of the encyclopedic collection edifying literature initiated by Akbar.
Hence, option (a) is correct.

5. The world's second tallest statue in sitting pose of Ramanuja was inaugurated by the Prime Minister of India at Hyderabad recently. Which one of the following statements correctly represents the teachings of Ramanuja?

(a) The best means of salvation was devotion.

(b) Vedas are eternal, self-existent and wholly authoritative.

(c) Logical arguments were essential means for the highest bliss

(d) Salvation was to be obtained through meditation.

Ans: (a)

Explanation:

Ramanuja, born in Tamil Nadu in the eleventh century, was deeply influenced by the Alvars. According to him the best means of attaining salvation was through intense devotion to Vishnu. 
Vishnu in His grace helps the devotee to attain the bliss of union with Him. 
He propounded the doctrine of Vishishtadvaita or qualified oneness in that the soul even when united with the Supreme God remained distinct. 
Ramanuja’s doctrine greatly inspired the new strand of bhakti which developed in north India subsequently.
Hence, option (a) is correct.

6. The Prime Minister recently inaugurated the new Circuit House near Somnath Temple at Veraval. Which of the following statements are correct regarding Somnath Temple?

1. Somnath Temple is one of the Jyotirlinga shrines.

2. A description of Somnath Temple was given by Al-Biruni.

3. Pran Pratishtha of Somnath Temple (installation of the present day temple) was done by President S. Radhakrishnan.

Select the correct answer using the code given below:

(a) 1 and 2 only

(b) 2 and 3 only

(c) 1 and 3 only

(d) 1, 2 and 3

Ans: (a)

Explanation:

Somnath temple stands at the shore of the Arabian ocean on the western corner of the Indian subcontinent in Gujarat State.
Shree Somnath is first among the twelve Aadi Jyotirlingas of India. Hence, statement 1 is correct. 
It was mentioned by the Arab traveller Al-Biruni in his travelogue, influenced by which Mahmud Ghaznavi attacked the Somnath temple in 1024 with his five thousand soldiers and looted its property and completely destroyed the temple. Hence, statement 2 is correct. 
The research based on ancient Indian classical texts show that first Somnath Jyotirling Pran-Pratistha was done on the auspicious third day of the brighter half of Shravan month during the tenth Treta yug of Vaivswat Manvantar.
The modern temple was reconstructed with the resolve of Sardar Patel who visited the ruins of Somnath temple on November 13 1947. Then President of India, Dr. Rajendra Prasad, did the Pran-Pratistha at the existing temple on 11 May 1951. Hence, statement 3 is NOT correct.

7. Which one of the following statements best describes the role of B cells and T cells in the human body?

(a) They protect the body from environmental allergens.

(b) They alleviate the body's pain and inflammation.

(c) They act as immunosuppressants in the body.

(d) They protect the body from the diseases caused by pathogens.

Ans: (d)

Explanation:

The primary and secondary immune responses are carried out with the help of two special types(T cells)  of lymphocytes present in our blood, i.e., B-lymphocytes (B cells) and T lymphocytes .
The B-lymphocytes produce an army of proteins in response to pathogens into our blood to fight with them. These proteins are called antibodies. The T-cells themselves do not secrete antibodies but help B cells produce them.
Hence, option (d) is correct.

8. Consider the following statements:

1. Other than those made by humans, nanoparticles do not exist in nature.

2. Nanoparticles of some metallic oxides are used in the manufacture of some cosmetics.

3. Nanoparticles of some commercial products which enter the environment are unsafe for humans.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only

(b) 3 only

(c) 1 and 2

(d) 2 and 3

Ans: (d)

Explanation:

Nanoparticles occur naturally in the environment in large volumes. They exist in the natural world and are also created as a result of human activities. Hence, statement 1 is NOT correct. 
The cosmetic industry is attaining the benefits of nanotechnology by developing nanoparticles for the enhanced performance and bioavailability of active components in cosmetics, sunscreens, anti-aging creams, moisturizers, and perfumes. The cosmetics are formulated by using different types of metal and metal oxide nanoparticles such as silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs), zinc oxide nanoparticles, (ZnO NPs), iron oxide nanoparticles, (Fe2O3 NPs) and carbon-based NPs [16–18]. 
The nanoparticles such as titanium dioxide (TiO2), zinc oxide (ZnO) are substantially used, since these nanoparticles are non-oily, easily absorbed. 
TiO2 is essentially a UV filter (UVA and UVB filter) hence widely used in sunscreens and moisturizers as well. Hence, statement 2 is correct. 
Humans have evolved to cope with most naturally occurring nanoparticles. However, some nanoparticles, generated as a result of certain human activities such as tobacco smoking and fires, account for many premature deaths as a result of lung damage. Hence, statement 3 is correct.

9. Consider the following statements :

DNA Barcoding can be a tool to:

1. assess the age of a plant or animal.

2. distinguish among species that look alike.

3. identify undesirable animal or plant materials in processed foods.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only

(b) 3 only

(c) 1 and 2

(d) 2 and 3

Ans: (d)

Explanation:

The novel technique of identifying biological specimens using short DNA sequences from either nuclear or organelle genomes is called DNA barcoding. 
DNA barcoding has many applications in various fields like preserving natural resources, protecting endangered species, controlling agriculture pests, identifying disease vectors, monitoring water quality, authentication of natural health products and identification of medicinal plants. 
Species identification of endangered wildlife (hence, distinguishes among species that look alike), quarantine pests, and disease vectors (identifying undesirable animals/plants) are just a few areas in which DNA barcoding is enabling researchers, enforcement agents, and consumers to make informed decisions in much shorter time frames. 
Statement 2 and statement 3 are correct, Hence, option (d) is correct (by elimination).

10. Consider the following:

1. Carbon monoxide

2. Nitrogen oxide

3. Ozone

4. Sulphur dioxide

Excess of which of the above in the environment is/are cause(s) of acid rain?

(a) 1, 2 and 3

(b) 2 and 4 only

(c) 4 only

(d) 1, 3 and 4

Ans: (b)

Explanation:

Acid rain is a byproduct of a variety of human activities that emit the oxides of sulphur and nitrogen in the atmosphere. Burning of fossil fuels (which contain sulphur and nitrogenous matter) such as coal and oil in power stations and furnaces or petrol and diesel in motor engines produce sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. 
SO2 and NO2 after oxidation and reaction with water are major contributors to acid rain, because polluted air usually contains particulate matter that catalyse the oxidation.
2SO2 (g) + O2 (g) + 2H2O (l) → 2H2SO4 (aq)
4NO2 (g) + O2 (g)+ 2H2O (l) → 4HNO3 (aq)
Hence, option (b) is correct.

11. Consider the following statements:

1. High clouds primarily reflect solar radiation and cool the surface of the Earth.

2. Low clouds have a high absorption of infrared radiation emanating from the Earth's surface and thus cause warming effect.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only

(b) 2 only

(c) Both 1 and 2

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

Ans: (d)

Explanation:

The study of clouds, where they occur, and their characteristics, play a key role in the understanding of climate change. Low, thick clouds primarily reflect solar radiation and cool the surface of the Earth. High, thin clouds primarily transmit incoming solar radiation; at the same time, they trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation emitted by the Earth and radiate it back downward, thereby warming the surface of the Earth. Hence, both statements are not correct.

53. "If rainforests and tropical forests are the lungs of the Earth, then surely wetlands function as its kidneys." Which one of the following functions of wetlands best reflects the above statement?

(a) The water cycle in wetlands involves surface runoff subsoil percolation and evaporation.

(b) Algae form the nutrient base upon which fish, crustaceans, molluscs, birds, reptiles and mammals thrive.

(c) Wetlands play vital role in maintaining sedimentation balance and soil stabilization.

(d) Aquatic plants absorb heavy metals and excess nutrients.

Ans: (d)

Explanation:

Wetland ecosystems are rich in biodiversity and support an astonishing variety and number of life forms, making them uniquely productive. Wetlands start by playing a crucial role in the water cycle, the nutrient cycle and the carbon cycle. The nutrient cycle, in turn, influences water quality, and the carbon cycle influences vegetative land cover and carbon sequestration in soils.
Most freshwater wetlands are rich in aquatic plants. Some aquatic plants can also absorb carbon under certain conditions and become peat. These plants are also capable of absorbing pollutants such as heavy metals and cleansing the water system. They absorb excess nutrients and contribute to achieving a vital balance in the system through the processes of denitrification and detoxification and oxygenation of water. If rainforests and tropical forests are the lungs of the earth, then surely wetlands function as its kidneys.
Hence, option (d) is correct.

Explanation:

The 1963 Bill prepared by the Satyapal Committee was reviewed by a Joint Committee of Parliament (1969-70) (Bhargava Committee). Based on which the Contempt of Court Act, 1971 was enacted. Hence statement 1 is correct.
Article 129 of the Constitution empowered the Supreme Court to punish for contempt of self. Article 215 gave the respective power to the High Courts. Hence statement 2 is correct.
According to the Contempt of Court Act, 1971,  contempt refers to the offence of showing disrespect to the dignity or authority of a court. The expression ‘contempt of court’ has not been defined by the Constitution. However, Article 129 of the Constitution empowers the Supreme Court to punish for contempt of self. Hence statement 3 is not correct.
The power to punish for contempt is a constitutional power vested in the Supreme Court which cannot be curtailed or abolished even by a legislative act. Article 142(2) states that "subject to the provisions of any law made by Parliament in this behalf" the Supreme Court shall have full power to make any order on the punishment of contempt. Hence statement 4 is correct.

Its members are elected from amongst lawyers in India and thus represent the Indian Bar. It sets standards of professional conduct, etiquette and exercises disciplinary jurisdiction over the bar.
It also sets standards for legal education and provides recognition to universities whose law degrees will serve as qualifications for students to enroll as advocates at the undergraduate level. Hence, statement 2 is correct.
83. Consider the following statements:

(c) 1 and 3 only

(d) 1, 2 and 3

(b) 2 only

(c) 1 and 3

(d) 3 only

The resolution of the proclamation of emergency will be required to be passed by a majority of the total number of members of each House of Parliament and 2/3 majority of the members present and voting. A Declaration of National Emergency is placed before each House of Parliament and if it is not approved within a month, it does not remain in force, but once approved, it can remain in operation for six months. As a result, the Proclamation of Emergency is ratified by both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha. It is not the exclusive power of the Lok Sabha. Hence, statement 1 is not correct.
The impeachment motion of the President should be passed by a special majority (two-thirds) in the original house. The motion is then sent to the other house for consideration. The second house acts as an inspector. A Select Committee has been constituted to investigate the allegations against the President. Impeachment of the President of India comes under both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. It is not the exclusive power of Lok Sabha. Hence, statement 3 is not correct.

(b) 2 only

(c) Both 1 and 2

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

Ans: (b)

Explanation:

A public representative can be disqualified under the Anti-Defection Act if:

A member abstains from voting.
After the expiry of six months, a nominated member joins a political party.
Therefore, any nominated MLA can join any political party within six months of being appointed to the House but not after six months. Hence statement 1 is not correct.
As per the law, the Speaker of the House has the power to decide the disqualification of the members.
If any complaint is received regarding the party of the Speaker of the House, any other member elected by the House has the right to take a decision in this regard. Therefore, this law does not prescribe any time period within which the presiding officer has to decide the defection case. Hence statement 2 is correct.

They assist the Attorney General in carrying out official duties. The Constitution does not mention the solicitor general and additional solicitor general. Hence statement 1 not correct.
The procedure and grounds for removal of the Attorney General are not mentioned in the Constitution. He holds office during the pleasure of the President (may be removed by the President at any time). Therefore, the Attorney General of India does not resign on the resignation of the government. Hence statement 2 is not correct.

(a) 1 and 2 only

(b) 2 and 3 only

(c) 1 and 3 only

Ans: (c)

Explanation:

Mandamus is issued to direct a public authority to do its duty. Mandamus is a judicial remedy in the form of an order from a court. It cannot be issued to compel an authority to do something against a statutory provision. Therefore, no mandate will be issued against any private organisation unless it has been entrusted with any public work. Hence option 1 is correct.
Mandamus is issued by the court to a public official asking him to perform his official duties that he has failed or refused to perform. It can also be issued against any public body, a corporation, an inferior court, a tribunal or government for the same purpose. Hence, statement 2 is not correct. 
The Supreme Court or High Court issues this writ to prevent illegal usurpation of public office by any person. Through this writ, the court examines the validity of a person's claim to public office. This writ empowers any person other than the aggrieved person to seek redress. Therefore, any public-prone person can be a petitioner to move the court to obtain a writ of right. Hence option 3 is correct.

Explanation:

According to the rules of procedure and conduct of business in the Lok Sabha, “The election of the Deputy Speaker shall be held on such date as may be decided by the Speaker. As per convention, the post of Deputy Speaker is given to the opposition party in India. Hence, option 1 is correct.
Till the 10th Lok Sabha, both the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker were usually elected from the ruling party. Since the 11th Lok Sabha, it has been a general consensus that the post of Speaker is given to the ruling party/coalition and the post of Deputy Speaker is given to the main opposition party. Hence option 2 is correct.
He is the final interpreter of the provisions of the Constitution of India, the rules of procedure and conduct of business of the Lok Sabha and parliamentary matters inside the House. In matters of interpretation of these provisions, it often gives decisions which are respected by the members and which are binding in nature. That is, his decision is final. Article 95 provides for the power of the Vice-Chairman or other person to perform the duties of the office of the Speaker or to act as the Speaker. Therefore, while presiding over the sitting of the House by the Deputy Speaker, his power is exactly the same as that of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha and no appeal can lie against his decisions. Hence option 3 is correct.
The Deputy Speaker is elected by the Lok Sabha from among its members. After the election of the Speaker, the Deputy Speaker is also elected. Hence option 4 is not correct.

92. With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following statements:

1. An increase in Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) indicates the appreciation of rupee.

2. An increase in the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) indicates an improvement in trade competitiveness.

3. An increasing trend in domestic inflation relative to inflation in other countries is likely to cause an increasing divergence between NEER and REER.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only

(b) 2 and 3 only

(c) 1 and 3 only

(d) 1, 2 and 3

Ans: (c)

Explanation:

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) tabulates the 'Nominal Effective Exchange Rate-NEER' of the rupee with respect to the currencies of 36 trading partner countries. It is a type of weighted index, that is, in this, more importance is given to those countries with which India does more business. A decrease in this index reflects a depreciation in the value of the rupee, while an increase in the index reflects an appreciation in the value of the rupee.
Apart from NEER, 'Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) is also an important parameter to measure the changes taking place in the Indian economy. Under REER, apart from other factors included in NEER, domestic inflation in various economies is also taken into account, due to which its importance increases.
NEER is the weighted average of the bilateral exchange rates of the domestic currency with respect to foreign currencies. Whereas REER is the weighted average of the domestic currency relative to other major currencies, adjusted for the effects of inflation.
NEER is an indicator of a country's international competitiveness in the foreign exchange market. REER is calculated after adjusting the price change in NEER. Thus, economists give more importance to REER than NEER.
NEER = Domestic Exchange Rate in terms of Special Drawing Rights (SDR) / Foreign Exchange Rate in terms of Special Drawing Rights (SDR)
REER = NEER × (Domestic Price Index/Foreign Price Index). Hence statements 1 and 3 are correct.

Which of the statements given above are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only

(b) 2 and 3 only

(c) 1 and 3 only

(d) 1, 2 and 3

Ans: (a)

Explanation:

According to the Reserve Bank of India,

CIB released in 1997 provided inflation protection only for principal and not for interest payment. While new products of IIB would provide inflation protection for both principal and interest payment.
The interest rate will be protected from inflation by paying a fixed coupon rate on the principal adjusted against inflation. And the government can reduce the coupon rates on its borrowings in the form of IIBs.
Hence statements 1 and 2 are correct.
Inflation Indexed Bonds (IIBs) were issued during 1997 in the name of Capital Indexed Bonds (CIBs). And IIBs can also be traded in the secondary market (through BSE, NSE, and other stock exchanges), However, if they are sold in the secondary market and profit is made, capital gains tax has to be paid. Hence statement 3 is not correct.
