Endogenic and exogenic forces are the driving forces behind geomorphic processes, which continuously modify the Earth's surface.

- **Endogenic forces** originate from within the Earth and cause phenomena like mountain building (diastrophism) and volcanic eruptions.
    
- **Exogenic forces** stem from external factors and include weathering caused by elements, mass wasting due to gravity, erosion by wind, water, or glaciers, and deposition of eroded materials.
    

Geomorphic agents are essentially the tools that carry out these processes. These agents include:

- Running water (rivers and streams)
- Groundwater
- Glaciers
- Wind
- Waves and ocean currents

These processes and agents are often intertwined. For instance, water can weather rocks and then transport the broken-down material (erosion) to be deposited elsewhere.

Understanding these forces is crucial for grasping how landscapes evolve over vast timescales.
