BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY AND WEATHERING
Biological weathering is contribution to or
removal of minerals and ions from the
weathering environment and physical changes
due to growth or movement of organisms.
Burrowing and wedging by organisms like
earthworms, termites, rodents etc., help in
exposing the new surfaces to chemical attack
and assists in the penetration of moisture and
air. Human beings by disturbing vegetation,
ploughing and cultivating soils, also help in
mixing and creating new contacts between
air, water and minerals in the earth materials.
Decaying plant and animal matter help in the
production of humic, carbonic and other
acids which enhance decay and solubility of
some elements. Plant roots exert a tremendous
pressure on the earth materials mechanically
breaking them apart.

Biological weathering involves the ways living organisms directly and indirectly contribute to the breakdown of rocks and minerals. Here's a breakdown of these processes:

- **Burrowing and Wedging:** Animals like earthworms, rodents, and insects actively break apart rocks and soil through their burrowing activities. This exposes fresh rock surfaces to air and water, facilitating further chemical and physical weathering. Plant roots exert similar effects, penetrating cracks and applying pressure as they grow, widening fractures, and splitting rocks.
    
- **Chemical Influences:** Decomposing plant and animal matter release organic acids (humic, carbonic, etc.) into the soil. These acids increase the acidity of water within the soil and rock, accelerating the dissolution of certain minerals. Tree roots can also secrete substances that directly dissolve rock minerals to access nutrients.
    
- **Human Impact:** Human activities such as deforestation, agriculture, and construction significantly disturb the landscape. The removal of vegetation and mixing of soil layers exposes rocks and minerals to enhanced weathering processes. Additionally, industrial activities and pollution can create acidic conditions that intensify the chemical weathering of rocks and structures.
    

Biological weathering works hand-in-hand with chemical and physical weathering processes. By fracturing rocks and producing acids, organisms make rocks more susceptible to other weathering forces, ultimately contributing to the reshaping of landscapes, soil formation, and the release of nutrients into the environment.
