Physical Weathering Processes
Physical or mechanical weathering processes
depend on some applied forces. The applied
forces could be: (i) gravitational forces such as
overburden pressure, load and shearing stress;
(ii) expansion forces due to temperature
changes, crystal growth or animal activity;
(iii) water pressures controlled by wetting and
drying cycles. Many of these forces are applied
both at the surface and within different earth
materials leading to rock fracture. Most of
the physical weathering processes are caused
by thermal expansion and pressure release.
These processes are small and slow but can
cause great damage to the rocks because of
continued fatigue the rocks suffer due to
repetition of contraction and expansion.

You're absolutely right about exfoliation being a result, not a process in itself. Here's a revised explanation focusing on how different processes cause exfoliation, along with examples:

Exfoliation is the peeling off of curved rock layers, creating smooth, rounded surfaces. There are a few primary mechanisms that drive exfoliation:

- **Unloading:** When large masses of overlying rock are eroded, the underlying rock experiences a decrease in pressure. This can cause it to expand, creating internal stresses and leading to fractures parallel to the exposed surface. These fractures eventually cause sheets of rock to peel away. Yosemite National Park's Half Dome is a classic example of an exfoliation dome formed mainly through unloading.
    
- **Thermal Expansion & Contraction:** Repeated heating and cooling cycles due to temperature fluctuations cause rocks to expand and contract. This differential expansion and contraction, especially affecting outer rock layers, can create stresses that lead to fracturing and the separation of rock sheets. Exfoliation due to temperature variations often creates smaller, onion-like layers of peeling rock.
    
- **Salt weathering:** In coastal or arid regions, salt crystal growth within rock pores can exert enough pressure to cause fractures and peeling. This process, while contributing to exfoliation, usually works on a smaller scale than unloading or thermal expansion.
    

It's important to note that exfoliation can often be the result of a combination of these processes working together over time.
