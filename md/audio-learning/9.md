Climatic factors being equal, the intensity
of action of exogenic geomorphic processes
depends upon type and structure of rocks. The
term structure includes such aspects of rocks
as folds, faults, orientation and inclination of
beds, presence or absence of joints, bedding
planes, hardness or softness of constituent
minerals, chemical susceptibility of mineral
constituents; the permeability or impermeabilityetc. 
Different types of rocks with differences in
their structure offer varying resistances to
various geomorphic processes. A particular
rock may be resistant to one process and nonresistant
to another. And, under varying
climatic conditions, particular rocks may
exhibit different degrees of resistance to
geomorphic processes and hence they operate
at differential rates and give rise to differences
in topography. The effects of most of the
exogenic geomorphic processes are small and
slow and may be imperceptible in a short time
span, but will in the long run affect the rocks
severely due to continued fatigue.
Finally, it boils down to one fact that the
differences on the surface of the earth though
originally related to the crustal evolution
continue to exist in some form or the other due
to differences in the type and structure of earth
materials, differences in geomorphic processes
and in their rates of operation.
Some of the exogenic geomorphic processes
have been dealt in detail here.

Absolutely! Let's explore how rock type and structure dictate the landscape, even when the climate stays the same:

**Rocks: Not All Created Equal**

- **Variation in Resistance:** Different rocks possess varying degrees of resistance to weathering and erosion. This is due to factors including:
    
    - **Mineral Composition:** Some minerals dissolve easily (e.g. limestone), others are highly resistant (e.g. quartz).
    - **Hardness:** Harder rocks withstand abrasion and weathering better than softer ones.
    - **Structural Features:** Fractures, joints, and bedding planes provide pathways for water to weaken the rock.
- **Differential Weathering:** A landscape with mixed rock types weathers at different rates. Resistant rocks form ridges or uplands, while less resistant rocks are eroded into valleys and lowlands. This creates topographic variation.
    

**The Influence of Geological Structure**

- **Folds and Faults:** Tilted or folded rock layers create varying slopes and exposure. Faults (fractures) create lines of weakness vulnerable to weathering and erosion.
- **Orientation:** The direction in which a rock layer faces influences sunlight exposure and weathering rates.
- **Permeability:** Porous rock allows water to infiltrate, leading to faster breakdown compared to impermeable rock.

**Examples:**

- **Limestone Regions:** Susceptible to chemical weathering, forming caves, underground drainage, and a distinctive "karst" landscape.
- **Granite Landscapes:** Granite, being hard and resistant, tends to form uplands and prominent peaks.
- **Layered Sedimentary Rocks:** Variations in resistance among different layers creates a stepped or benched landscape.

**Climate and Rock: A Dynamic Duo**

- **Rock Behavior in Different Climates:** A rock that crumbles readily in a wet climate might be durable in an arid region. Climatic factors strongly modify how rock structure influences landscape formation.

**Time and Persistence**

- **Small Changes, Big Impact:** Exogenic processes are often slow but continuous. The differential weathering of rocks over vast timescales creates major topographical differences.

**The Bigger Picture**

- **Beyond Just Today:** Landscapes carry a legacy. The current variations in topography are a result of both past geological structures and their interplay with weathering and erosion processes throughout time.

**Key Takeaways**

- Even when the climate remains the same, the way it shapes the Earth depends entirely on the types of rocks and the structural features present.
- Understanding the interaction between rock properties and exogenic forces is fundamental for explaining the diversity of landforms we observe across the globe.
