The work of the other two agents of
erosion-waves and ground water is not
controlled by climate. In case of waves it is
the location along the interface of litho and
hydro sphere — coastal region — that will
determine the work of waves, whereas the
work of ground water is determined more by
the lithological character of the region. If the
rocks are permeable and soluble and water
is available only then karst topography
develops. In the next chapter we shall be
dealing with the landforms produced by each
of these agents of erosion.
Deposition is a consequence of erosion.
The erosional agents loose their velocity and
hence energy on gentler slopes and the
materials carried by them start to settle
themselves. In other words, deposition is not
actually the work of any agent. The coarser
materials get deposited first and finer ones
later. By deposition depressions get filled up.
The same erosional agents viz., running water,
glaciers, wind, waves and groundwater act as
aggradational or depositional agents also.
What happens to the surface of the earth
due to erosion and deposition is elaborated
in the next chapter on landforms and their
evolution

Let's explore how different forces shape our planet's landscapes and focus on the distinction between climate-driven erosion and other powerful factors.

**Beyond Climate: Waves and Groundwater**

- **Waves:** Waves relentlessly sculpt the coastlines. Their impact depends not on the weather, but the very interface between ocean and land. This constant battering can carve dramatic cliffs, arches, and caves.
    
- **Groundwater:** This hidden sculptor works underground. It dissolves soluble rocks, particularly limestone, forming a unique landscape known as karst topography. Think of underground cave systems, sinkholes, and disappearing streams. The type of rock present plays a major role here.
    

**Erosion and Deposition: A Cycle of Change**

Remember that deposition, the building up of landforms, is intrinsically linked to erosion. When forces like rivers, glaciers, or wind slow down, they lose their power to carry the material they've eroded.

Picture this: a fast-flowing mountain stream carries rocks and pebbles. As it reaches flatter ground, the water slows, and those rocks settle to the bottom. Over time, these deposits build up, altering the landscape.

- **What Gets Deposited When?** It's about size and energy. Heavier, coarser materials settle first, followed by finer sand and silt. This can create distinct layers in the deposited material.

**Dual Roles**

Interestingly, the forces that erode in one location can be builders in another. Rivers deposit eroded material, creating deltas and floodplains. Windblown sand can form towering dunes. Glaciers can leave behind piles of debris called moraines.

**The Bigger Picture**

Erosion and deposition are in a never-ending cycle, redistributing and transforming the Earth's surface. Understanding these forces allows us to predict areas prone to change, appreciate the breathtaking features they create, and gain insight into our planet's ongoing evolution.
