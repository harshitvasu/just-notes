The Government of India (GOI) recognizes the importance of protecting its rivers and streams, which are vital lifelines for the nation. Here's a look at some of the major conservation efforts underway:

**Legislative Framework:**

* **Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974:** This act establishes a regulatory framework for preventing and controlling water pollution. It empowers authorities to set effluent discharge standards and enforce compliance.
* **River Conservation Programs:**  Several programs specifically target river conservation. These include:
    * **National River Conservation Directorate (NRCD):** Established in 1995, the NRCD focuses on pollution abatement measures in major Indian rivers. It provides financial and technical assistance to states for projects like sewage treatment plants and interception of sewage discharge.
    * **Namami Gange Programme:**  Launched in 2014, this ambitious program focuses on cleaning the Ganges River, one of India's most sacred and polluted rivers. It aims to address issues like sewage treatment, industrial waste management, and riverfront development.
    * **Interlinking of Rivers Project:** Though a controversial proposal, this project aims to divert water from surplus rivers to water-scarce regions. Proponents argue it can improve water management, while critics raise concerns about ecological impacts.

**Other Initiatives:**

* **National Water Mission:** Launched in 2011, this mission aims to conserve water, minimize waste, and ensure equitable water distribution.
* **Promoting Public Awareness:** Campaigns to educate the public about the importance of river conservation and the need to prevent pollution.
* **Catchment Area Management:** Efforts to conserve forests and manage land use practices in river basins to minimize soil erosion and sedimentation in rivers.
* **Biodiversity Conservation:** Protecting aquatic species and their habitats within rivers and streams.

**Challenges and the Way Forward:**

Despite these efforts, India's rivers face significant challenges. Pollution from industrial waste, agricultural runoff, and untreated sewage remains a major concern. Additionally, overexploitation of water resources for irrigation and hydropower projects strains river health. 

The success of conservation efforts hinges on a multi-pronged approach. Continued investment in pollution control infrastructure, stricter enforcement of environmental regulations, and promoting sustainable water use practices are crucial.  Community engagement and fostering a sense of stewardship towards rivers is also essential. By addressing these challenges and continuing conservation efforts, India can strive for cleaner, healthier rivers that sustain the nation for generations to come.
