## Chapter 6 Landforms and their evolution
### Introduction
After **weathering processes** have had their actions on the **earth materials** making up the surface of the earth, the **geomorphic agents** like **running water**, **ground water**, **wind**, **glaciers**, **waves** perform **erosion**. It is already known to you that erosion causes changes on the surface of the earth. **Deposition** follows erosion and because of deposition too, changes occur on the surface of the earth.

As this chapter deals with **landforms** and their **evolution**, ‘first’ start with the question, what is a landform? In simple words, **small to medium tracts or parcels** of the earth’s surface are called landforms. Several related landforms together make up **landscapes** (large tracts of earth’s surface). Each landform has its own physical **shape, size, materials** and is a result of the action of certain **geomorphic processes** and **agent(s)**. Actions of most of the geomorphic processes and agents are **slow**, and hence the results take a long time to take shape. Every landform has a beginning. Landforms once formed may change in their **shape, size, and nature** slowly or fast due to continued action of geomorphic processes and agents.

Due to changes in **climatic conditions** and **vertical or horizontal movements** of **landmasses**, either the intensity of processes or the processes themselves might change leading to new modifications in the landforms. **Evolution** here implies **stages of transformation** of either a part of the earth’s surface from one landform into another or transformation of individual landforms after they are once formed. That means, each and every landform has a **history of development** and **changes through time**. A landmass passes through **stages of development** somewhat comparable to the stages of life — **youth, mature and old age**.

### RUNNING WATER
In **humid regions**, which receive **heavy rainfall**, **running water** is considered the most important of the **geomorphic agents** in bringing about the **degradation of the land surface**. There are two components of running water. One is **overland flow** on general land surface as a sheet. Another is **linear flow** as streams and rivers in valleys. Most of the **erosional landforms** made by running water are associated with **vigorous and youthful rivers** flowing over **steep gradients**.

With time, **stream channels** over steep gradients turn gentler due to continued erosion, and as a consequence, lose their velocity, facilitating active **deposition**. There may be depositional forms associated with streams flowing over steep slopes. But these phenomena will be on a small scale compared to those associated with **rivers flowing over medium to gentle slopes**. The gentler the river channels in gradient or slope, the greater is the deposition. When the stream beds turn gentler due to continued erosion, **downward cutting** becomes less dominant and **lateral erosion** of banks increases and as a consequence the **hills and valleys** are reduced to **plains**.

---

**Youth** Streams are few during this stage with **poor integration** and flow over original slopes showing **shallow V-shaped valleys** with no floodplains or with very narrow floodplains along trunk streams. **Stream divides** are broad and flat with **marshes, swamps, and lakes**. Meanders, if present, develop over these broad upland surfaces. These meanders may eventually entrench themselves into the uplands. **Waterfalls** and **rapids** may exist where local hard rock bodies are exposed.

**Mature** During this stage streams are plenty with **good integration**. The valleys are still V-shaped but deep; trunk streams are broad enough to have **wider floodplains** within which streams may flow in meanders confined within the valley. The flat and broad inter-stream areas and swamps and marshes of youth disappear and the **stream divides turn sharp**. Waterfalls and rapids disappear.

**Old** Smaller tributaries during old age are few with **gentle gradients**. Streams meander freely over **vast floodplains** showing **natural levees**, **oxbow lakes**, etc. Divides are broad and flat with **lakes, swamps, and marshes**. Most of the landscape is at or slightly above sea level.

### **EROSIONAL LANDFORMS**

#### **Valleys** 
Valleys start as small and narrow **rills**; the rills will gradually develop into long and wide **gullies**; the gullies will further deepen, widen and lengthen to give rise to valleys. Depending upon dimensions and shape, many types of valleys like **V-shaped valley**, **gorge**, **canyon**, etc. can be recognized. A gorge is a deep valley with very steep to straight sides and a canyon is characterized by steep step-like side slopes and may be as deep as a gorge. A gorge is almost equal in width at its top as well as its bottom. In contrast, a canyon is wider at its top than at its bottom. In fact, a canyon is a variant of gorge. **Valley types** depend upon the type and structure of rocks in which they form. For example, canyons commonly form in **horizontal bedded sedimentary rocks** and gorges form in **hard rocks**.

---

#### **Potholes and Plunge Pools** 
Over the **rocky beds of hill-streams**, more or less **circular depressions** called potholes form because of **stream erosion** aided by the **abrasion of rock fragments**. Once a small and shallow depression forms, **pebbles and boulders** get collected in those depressions and get rotated by flowing water, and consequently, the depressions grow in dimensions. A series of such depressions eventually join, and the **stream valley** gets deepened. At the foot of **waterfalls**, large potholes, quite deep and wide, form because of the sheer impact of water and the rotation of boulders. Such large and deep holes at the base of waterfalls are called **plunge pools**.

---

#### **Incised or Entrenched Meanders** 
In streams that flow rapidly over **steep gradients**, normally **erosion** is concentrated on the **bottom of the stream channel**. Also, in the case of steep gradient streams, **lateral erosion** on the sides of the valleys is not much when compared to the streams flowing on low and gentle slopes. Because of active lateral erosion, streams flowing over gentle slopes develop **sinuous or meandering courses**. It is common to find meandering courses over **floodplains** and **delta plains** where stream gradients are very gentle. But very deep and wide meanders can also be found cut in **hard rocks**. Such meanders are called **incised or entrenched meanders**.

## DEPOSITIONAL LANDFORMS

### **Alluvial Fans** 
**Alluvial fans** are formed when **streams flowing from higher levels** break into **foot slope plains** of low gradient. Normally, very **coarse load** is carried by streams flowing over **mountain slopes**. This load becomes too heavy for the streams to be carried over gentler gradients and gets dumped and spread as a broad low to high **cone-shaped deposit** called an alluvial fan. Usually, the streams which flow over fans are not confined to their original channels for long and shift their position across the fan, forming many channels called **distributaries**. Alluvial fans in humid areas show normally **low cones with gentle slope** from head to toe, and they appear as **high cones with steep slopes** in arid and semi-arid climates.

### **Deltas** 
**Deltas** are like **alluvial fans** but develop at a different location. The load carried by the rivers is dumped and spread into the **sea**. If this load is not carried away far into the sea or distributed along the coast, it spreads and accumulates as a **low cone**. Unlike in alluvial fans, the deposits making up deltas are very well **sorted** with clear **stratification**. The coarsest materials settle out first and the finer fractions like **silts and clays** are carried out into the sea. As the delta grows, the **river distributaries** continue to increase in length, and the delta continues to build up into the sea.

### **Floodplains, Natural Levees, and Point Bars** 
Deposition develops a **floodplain** just as erosion makes valleys. A floodplain is a major landform of **river deposition**. Large-sized materials are deposited first when the stream channel breaks into a gentle slope. Thus, normally, fine-sized materials like **sand, silt, and clay** are carried by relatively slow-moving waters in gentler channels usually found in the plains and deposited over the bed and when the waters spill over the banks during flooding above the bed.

---

A **river bed** made of river deposits is the active floodplain. The floodplain above the bank is the inactive floodplain. Inactive floodplains above the banks basically contain two types of deposits — **flood deposits** and **channel deposits**. In plains, channels shift laterally and change their courses occasionally, leaving cut-off courses which get filled up gradually. Such areas over floodplains built up by abandoned or cut-off channels contain coarse deposits. The flood deposits of spilled waters carry relatively finer materials like silt and clay. The floodplains in a delta are called **delta plains**.

---

**Natural levees** and **point bars** are some of the important landforms found associated with floodplains. Natural levees are found along the banks of large rivers. They are low, linear, and parallel **ridges of coarse deposits** along the banks of rivers, quite often cut into individual mounds. Point bars, also known as **meander bars**, are found on the concave side of meanders of large rivers and are sediments deposited in a linear fashion by flowing waters along the bank. They are almost uniform in profile and in width and contain mixed sizes of sediments.

### **Meanders**
In large **flood** and **delta plains**, rivers rarely flow in straight courses. **Loop-like channel patterns** called meanders develop over flood and delta plains. A meander is not a landform but is only a type of channel pattern. This is because of:

(i) **Propensity of water** flowing over very gentle gradients to work laterally on the banks;  
(ii) **Unconsolidated nature of alluvial deposits** making up the banks with many irregularities which can be used by water exerting pressure laterally;  
(iii) **Coriolis force** acting on the fluid water deflecting it like it deflects the wind.

When the gradient of the channel becomes extremely low, water flows leisurely and starts working laterally. Slight **irregularities along the banks** slowly get transformed into a small curvature in the banks; the curvature deepens due to **deposition** on the inside of the curve and **erosion** along the bank on the outside. If there is no deposition and no erosion or undercutting, the tendency to meander is reduced. Normally, in meanders of large rivers, there is active deposition along the **concave bank** and undercutting along the **convex bank**. The concave bank is known as the **cut-off bank**, which shows up as a steep scarp, and the convex bank presents a long, gentle profile. As meanders grow into deep loops, they may get cut off due to erosion at the inflection points and are left as **ox-bow lakes**.

### **GROUNDWATER** 
Here the interest is not on groundwater as a resource. Our focus is on the **work of groundwater** in the **erosion of landmasses** and **evolution of landforms**. The **surface water** percolates well when the rocks are **permeable, thinly bedded, and highly jointed and cracked**. After vertically going down to some depth, the water under the ground flows **horizontally** through the **bedding planes, joints, or through the materials themselves**. It is this downward and horizontal movement of water which causes the rocks to erode.

**Physical or mechanical removal** of materials by moving groundwater is insignificant in developing landforms. That is why the results of the work of groundwater cannot be seen in all types of rocks. But in rocks like **limestones or dolomites** rich in **calcium carbonate**, the surface water as well as groundwater through the **chemical process of solution** and **precipitation deposition** develop varieties of landforms. These two processes of solution and precipitation are active in limestones or dolomites occurring either exclusively or interbedded with other rocks.

Any limestone or dolomitic region showing typical landforms produced by the action of groundwater through the processes of solution and deposition is called **Karst topography** after the typical topography developed in limestone rocks of the **Karst region** in the Balkans adjacent to the **Adriatic Sea**. The karst topography is also characterized by **erosional and depositional landforms**.

## **EROSIONAL LANDFORMS** 

### **Pools, Sinkholes, Lapies, and Limestone Pavements** 

Small to medium-sized round to sub-rounded shallow depressions called **swallow holes** form on the surface of **limestones** through solution. **Sinkholes** are very common in **limestone/karst areas**. A sinkhole is an opening more or less circular at the top and funnel-shaped towards the bottom, with sizes varying in area from a few sq. m to a hectare and with depth from less than half a meter to thirty meters or more. Some of these form solely through **solution action** (solution sinks), and others might start as solution forms first and if the bottom of a sinkhole forms the roof of a void or cave underground, it might collapse, leaving a large hole opening into a cave or a void below (**collapse sinks**). Quite often, sinkholes are covered up with soil mantle and appear as shallow **water pools**. Anybody stepping over such pools would go down like it happens in quicksands in deserts. The term **doline** is sometimes used to refer to collapse sinks. Solution sinks are more common than collapse sinks.

Quite often, the surface runoff simply goes down swallow and sinkholes and flows as **underground streams** and reemerges at a distance downstream through a cave opening. When sinkholes and dolines join together because of slumping of materials along their margins or due to roof collapse of caves, long, narrow to wide trenches called **valley sinks or Uvalas** form. Gradually, most of the surface of the limestone is eaten away by these pits and trenches, leaving it extremely irregular with a maze of points, grooves, and ridges or **lapies**. Especially, these ridges or lapies form due to differential solution activity along parallel to sub-parallel joints. The lapie field may eventually turn into somewhat smooth **limestone pavements**.

### **Caves**
In areas where there are **alternating beds of rocks** (shales, sandstones, quartzites) with **limestones or dolomites** in between or in areas where limestones are **dense, massive, and occurring as thick beds**, cave formation is prominent. **Water percolates down** either through the materials or through **cracks and joints** and moves horizontally along **bedding planes**. It is along these bedding planes that the limestone dissolves and long and narrow to wide gaps called **caves** result. There can be a **maze of caves** at different elevations depending upon the limestone beds and intervening rocks. Caves normally have an opening through which **cave streams** are discharged. Caves having openings at both ends are called **tunnels**.

### **Stalactites, Stalagmites, and Pillars** 
**Stalactites** hang as icicles of different diameters. Normally, they are broad at their bases and taper towards the free ends, showing up in a variety of forms. **Stalagmites** rise up from the floor of the caves. In fact, stalagmites form due to dripping water from the surface or through the thin pipe of the stalactite, immediately below it.

Stalagmites may take the shape of a column, a disc, with either a smooth, rounded bulging end or a miniature crater-like depression. The stalagmite and stalactites eventually fuse to give rise to **columns** and **pillars** of different diameters.

### **GLACIERS**
Masses of ice moving as sheets over the land (**continental glacier** or **piedmont glacier** if a vast sheet of ice is spread over the plains at the foot of mountains) or as linear flows down the slopes of mountains in broad trough-like valleys (**mountain and valley glaciers**) are called glaciers. The movement of glaciers is slow, unlike water flow. The movement could be a few centimeters to a few meters a day or even less or more. Glaciers move basically because of the **force of gravity**.

**Erosion by glaciers** is tremendous because of **friction caused by the sheer weight of the ice**. The material plucked from the land by glaciers (usually large-sized angular blocks and fragments) gets dragged along the floors or sides of the valleys and cause great damage through **abrasion and plucking**. Glaciers can cause significant damage to even un-weathered rocks and can reduce high mountains into low hills and plains.

As glaciers continue to move, debris gets removed, divides get lowered, and eventually the slope is reduced to such an extent that glaciers will stop moving, leaving only a mass of **low hills** and vast **outwash plains** along with other depositional features.

## **EROSIONAL LANDFORMS**

### **Cirque** 
**Cirques** are the most common landforms in **glaciated mountains**. The cirques are often found at the heads of **glacial valleys**. The accumulated ice cuts these cirques while moving down the mountain tops. They are **deep, long, and wide troughs or basins** with very steep concave to vertically dropping high walls at its head as well as sides. A lake of water can be seen quite often within the cirques after the glacier disappears. Such lakes are called **cirque** or **tarn lakes**. There can be two or more cirques, one leading into another down below in a stepped sequence.

### **Horns and Serrated Ridges** 
**Horns** form through **headward erosion** of the cirque walls. If three or more radiating glaciers cut headward until their cirques meet, high, sharp-pointed, and steep-sided peaks called horns form. The divides between cirque side walls or head walls get narrow because of progressive erosion and turn into **serrated** or **saw-toothed ridges**, sometimes referred to as **arêtes**, with very sharp crests and a zig-zag outline.

### **Glacial Valleys/Troughs** 

**Glaciated valleys** are **trough-like** and **U-shaped** with broad floors and relatively smooth, steep sides. The valleys may contain littered debris or debris shaped as **moraines** with a swampy appearance. There may be **lakes gouged out of rocky floors** or formed by debris within the valleys. There can be **hanging valleys** at an elevation on one or both sides of the main glacial valley. The faces of divides or spurs of such hanging valleys opening into main glacial valleys are quite often truncated to give them an appearance like **triangular facets**. Very deep glacial troughs filled with sea water and making up shorelines (in high latitudes) are called **fjords/fiords**.

## **Depositional Landforms** 
The unassorted coarse and fine debris dropped by the melting glaciers is called **glacial till**. Most of the rock fragments in till are **angular to sub-angular** in form. **Streams** form by melting ice at the bottom, sides, or lower ends of glaciers. Some amount of rock debris small enough to be carried by such meltwater streams is washed down and deposited. Such **glacio-fluvial deposits** are called **outwash deposits**. Unlike till deposits, the outwash deposits are roughly **stratified** and assorted. The rock fragments in outwash deposits are somewhat **rounded** at their edges.

### **Moraines** 
They are long ridges of deposits of **glacial till**. **Terminal moraines** are long ridges of debris deposited at the end (toe) of the glaciers. **Lateral moraines** form along the sides parallel to the glacial valleys. The lateral moraines may join a terminal moraine forming a **horse-shoe shaped ridge**. There can be many lateral moraines on either side in a glacial valley. These moraines partly or fully owe their origin to **glacio-fluvial waters** pushing up materials to the sides of glaciers.

Many valley glaciers retreating rapidly leave an irregular sheet of till over their valley floors. Such deposits varying greatly in thickness and in surface topography are called **ground moraines**. The moraine in the center of the glacial valley flanked by lateral moraines is called **medial moraine**. They are imperfectly formed compared to lateral moraines. Sometimes medial moraines are indistinguishable from ground moraines.

### **Eskers** 
When glaciers melt in summer, the water flows on the surface of the ice, seeps down along the margins, or even moves through holes in the ice. These waters accumulate beneath the glacier and flow like streams in a channel beneath the ice. Such streams flow over the ground (not in a valley cut in the ground) with ice forming its banks. Very coarse materials like **boulders and blocks** along with some minor fractions of rock debris carried into this stream settle in the **valley of ice beneath the glacier**. After the ice melts, these materials can be found as a sinuous ridge called an **esker**.
**Outwash Plains** The plains at the foot of the **glacial mountains** or beyond the limits of **continental ice sheets** are covered with **glacio-fluvial deposits** in the form of broad flat **alluvial fans** which may join to form **outwash plains** of gravel, silt, sand, and clay.

### **Drumlins** 
**Drumlins** are smooth oval-shaped ridge-like features composed mainly of **glacial till** with some masses of gravel and sand. The **long axes** of drumlins are parallel to the direction of ice movement. They may measure up to 1 km in length and 30 m or so in height. One end of the drumlins facing the glacier, called the **stoss end**, is blunter and steeper than the other end, called the tail. The drumlins form due to the dumping of rock debris beneath heavily loaded ice through fissures in the glacier. The stoss end gets blunted due to pushing by moving ice. Drumlins give an indication of the **direction of glacier movement**.

## **WAVES AND CURRENTS** 
**Coastal processes** are the most dynamic and hence most destructive. So, don’t you think it is important to know about the coastal processes and forms? Some of the changes along the coasts take place very fast. At one place, there can be **erosion in one season** and **deposition in another**. Most of the changes along the coasts are accomplished by **waves**. When waves break, the water is thrown with great force onto the shore, and simultaneously, there is a great churning of sediments on the sea bottom. Constant impact of breaking waves drastically affects the coasts. **Storm waves** and **tsunami waves** can cause far-reaching changes in a short period of time compared to normal breaking waves. As the **wave environment changes**, the intensity of the force of breaking waves changes.

Other than the action of waves, the coastal landforms depend upon: (i) the **configuration of land and sea floor**; (ii) whether the coast is advancing (**emerging**) seaward or retreating (**submerging**) landward. Assuming sea level to be constant, two types of coasts are considered to explain the concept of evolution of coastal landforms:

- **High, rocky coasts (submerged coasts)**
- **Low, smooth, and gently sloping sedimentary coasts (emerged coasts**

### **HIGH ROCKY COASTS** 
Along the high rocky coasts, the rivers appear to have been **drowned with a highly irregular coastline**. The coastline appears highly indented with extensions of water into the land where **glacial valleys (fjords)** are present. The hillsides drop off sharply into the water. Shores do not show any depositional landforms initially. **Erosion features dominate**.

Along high rocky coasts, waves break with great force against the land, shaping the hillsides into **cliffs**. With constant pounding by waves, the cliffs recede, leaving a **wave-cut platform** in front of the sea cliff. Waves gradually minimize the irregularities along the shore.

The materials that fall off and are removed from the sea cliffs gradually break into smaller fragments and roll to roundness, eventually getting deposited in the offshore. After a considerable period of cliff development and retreat, when the coastline turns somewhat smooth, with the addition of some more material to this deposit in the offshore, a **wave-built terrace** would develop in front of the wave-cut terrace. As the erosion along the coast takes place, a good supply of material becomes available to **longshore currents** and waves to deposit them as **beaches** along the shore and as **bars** (long ridges of sand and/or shingle parallel to the coast) in the nearshore zone. Bars are submerged features, and when bars show up above water, they are called **barrier bars**. A barrier bar that gets keyed up to the headland of a bay is called a **spit**. When barrier bars and spits form at the mouth of a bay and block it, a **lagoon** forms. The lagoons would gradually get filled up by sediments from the land, giving rise to a **coastal plain**.

### **LOW SEDIMENTARY COASTS** 
Along low sedimentary coasts, the rivers appear to **extend their length** by building **coastal plains and deltas**. The coastline appears smooth with occasional incursions of water in the form of **lagoons** and **tidal creeks**. The land slopes gently into the water. **Marshes and swamps** may abound along the coasts. **Depositional features dominate**.

When waves break over a gently sloping sedimentary coast, the bottom sediments get churned and move readily, building **bars**, **barrier bars**, **spits**, and **lagoons**. Lagoons would eventually turn into a swamp, which would subsequently turn into a coastal plain. The maintenance of these depositional features depends upon the steady supply of materials. **Storm and tsunami waves** cause drastic changes irrespective of the supply of sediments. Large rivers which bring lots of sediments build **deltas** along low sedimentary coasts.


## **EROSIONAL LANDFORMS** 

### **Cliffs, Terraces, Caves, and Stacks**

**Wave-cut cliffs** and **terraces** are two forms usually found where **erosion** is the dominant shore process. Almost all sea cliffs are steep and may range from a few meters to 30 meters or even more. At the foot of such cliffs, there may be a flat or gently sloping platform covered by rock debris derived from the sea cliff behind. Such platforms occurring at elevations above the average height of waves are called a **wave-cut terrace**. The lashing of waves against the base of the cliff and the rock debris that gets smashed against the cliff along with lashing waves create **hollows** that get widened and deepened to form **sea caves**. The roofs of caves collapse, and the sea cliffs recede further inland. Retreat of the cliff may leave some remnants of rock standing isolated as small islands just off the shore. Such resistant masses of rock, originally parts of a cliff or hill, are called **sea stacks**.

Like all other features, sea stacks are also temporary, and eventually, coastal hills and cliffs will disappear because of **wave erosion**, giving rise to narrow coastal plains. With the onrush of deposits from over the land behind, these plains may get covered up by **alluvium** or may get covered up by **shingle or sand** to form a wide beach.

## **DEPOSITIONAL LANDFORMS**

### **Beaches and Dunes**
**Beaches** are characteristic of shorelines that are dominated by **deposition**, but may occur as patches along even the rugged shores. Most of the sediment making up the beaches comes from land carried by the **streams and rivers** or from **wave erosion**. Beaches are temporary features. The sandy beach, which appears so permanent, may be reduced to a very narrow strip of coarse pebbles in some other season. Most of the beaches are made up of **sand-sized materials**. Beaches called **shingle beaches** contain excessively small pebbles and even cobbles.

Just behind the beach, the sands lifted and winnowed from over the beach surfaces will be deposited as **sand dunes**. Sand dunes forming long ridges parallel to the coastline are very common along **low sedimentary coasts**.

### **Bars, Barriers, and Spits** 
A ridge of sand and shingle formed in the sea in the offshore zone lying approximately parallel to the coast is called an **offshore bar**. An offshore bar that is exposed due to further addition of sand is termed a **barrier bar**. The offshore bars and barriers commonly form across the mouth of a river or at the entrance of a bay. Sometimes such barrier bars get keyed up to one end of the bay when they are called **spits**. Spits may also develop attached to headlands or hills. The barriers, bars, and spits at the mouth of the bay gradually extend, leaving only a small opening of the bay into the sea, and the bay will eventually develop into a **lagoon**. The lagoons get filled up gradually by sediment coming from the land or from the beach itself (aided by wind) and a broad and wide **coastal plain** may develop, replacing a lagoon.

## **WINDS** 
Wind is one of the two dominant agents in **hot deserts**. The desert floors get heated up too much and too quickly because of being **dry and barren**. The heated floors heat up the air directly above them and result in **upward movements** in the hot lighter air with turbulence, and any obstructions in its path set up eddies, whirlwinds, updrafts, and downdrafts. Winds also move along the desert floors with great speed, and the obstructions in their path create turbulence. Of course, there are **storm winds** which are very destructive.

Winds cause **deflation**, **abrasion**, and **impact**. **Deflation** includes lifting and removal of dust and smaller particles from the surface of rocks. In the transportation process, **sand and silt** act as effective tools to abrade the land surface. The impact is simply the sheer force of momentum, which occurs when sand is blown into or against a rock surface. It is similar to a sand-blasting operation. The wind action creates a number of interesting erosional and depositional features in the deserts.

In fact, many features of deserts owe their formation to **mass wasting** and **running water** as sheet floods. Though **rain is scarce** in deserts, it comes down torrentially in a short period of time. The desert rocks, devoid of vegetation, exposed to mechanical and chemical weathering processes due to drastic diurnal temperature changes, decay faster, and the torrential rains help in removing the weathered materials easily. That means the weathered debris in deserts is moved by not only wind but also by rain/sheet wash. The wind moves fine materials, and general mass erosion is accomplished mainly through **sheet floods** or **sheet wash**. **Stream channels** in desert areas are broad, smooth, and indefinite and flow for a brief time after rains.
## **EROSIONAL LANDFORMS**

### **Pediments and Pediplains** 
Landscape evolution in deserts is primarily concerned with the formation and extension of **pediments**. Gently inclined rocky floors close to the mountains at their foot, with or without a thin cover of debris, are called pediments. Such rocky floors form through the erosion of the mountain front through a combination of **lateral erosion by streams** and **sheet flooding**.

Erosion starts along the steep margins of the landmass or the steep sides of the tectonically controlled steep incision features over the landmass. Once pediments are formed with a steep wash slope followed by a cliff or free face above it, the steep wash slope and free face retreat backward. This method of erosion is termed **parallel retreat of slopes** through backwasting. So, through the parallel retreat of slopes, the pediments extend backward at the expense of the mountain front, and gradually, the mountain gets reduced, leaving an **inselberg**, which is a remnant of the mountain. That’s how the high relief in desert areas is reduced to low featureless plains called **pediplains**.

### **Playas** 
Plains are by far the most prominent landforms in the deserts. In basins with **mountains and hills** around, the drainage is towards the center of the basin, and due to gradual deposition of sediment from basin margins, a nearly level plain forms at the center of the basin. In times of sufficient water, this plain is covered by a shallow water body. Such shallow lakes are called **playas**, where water is retained only for a short duration due to evaporation, and quite often the playas contain good deposition of **salts**. The playa plain covered by salts is called **alkali flats**.

### **Deflation Hollows and Caves**
Weathered mantle from over the rocks or bare soil gets blown out by persistent movement of wind currents in one direction. This process may create shallow depressions called **deflation hollows**. Deflation also creates numerous small pits or cavities over rock surfaces. The rock faces suffer impact and abrasion from wind-borne sand, first creating shallow depressions called **blowouts**, and some of the blowouts become deeper and wider, fit to be called **caves**.


### **Mushroom, Table, and Pedestal Rocks**
Many rock outcrops in the deserts, easily susceptible to **wind deflation** and **abrasion**, are worn out quickly, leaving some remnants of resistant rocks polished beautifully in the shape of a **mushroom** with a slender stalk and a broad, rounded pear-shaped cap above. Sometimes, the top surface is broad like a **tabletop**, and quite often, the remnants stand out like **pedestals**.

## **Depositional Landforms** 
Wind is a good **sorting agent**. Depending upon the velocity of wind, different sizes of grains are moved along the floors by rolling or **saltation** and carried in suspension. In this process of transportation, the materials get sorted. When the wind slows or begins to die down, depending upon the sizes of grains and their critical velocities, the grains will begin to settle. So, in **depositional landforms** made by wind, good sorting of grains can be found. Since wind is everywhere and wherever there is a good source of sand and with constant wind directions, depositional features in **arid regions** can develop anywhere.

### **Sand Dunes** 
Dry hot deserts are ideal for **sand dune formation**. Obstacles to initiate dune formation are equally important. There can be a great variety of dune forms.

**Crescent-shaped dunes** called **barchans** with the points or wings directed away from the wind direction, i.e., downwind, form where the wind direction is constant and moderate and where the original surface over which sand is moving is almost uniform. **Parabolic dunes** form when sandy surfaces are partially covered with vegetation. Parabolic dunes are reversed barchans with the wind direction being the same. **Seif** dunes are similar to barchans with a small difference: seifs have only one wing or point. This happens when there is a shift in wind conditions. The lone wings of seifs can grow very long and high.

**Longitudinal dunes** form when the supply of sand is poor and wind direction is constant. They appear as long ridges of considerable length but low in height. **Transverse dunes** are aligned perpendicular to the wind direction. These dunes form when the wind direction is constant and the source of sand is an elongated feature at right angles to the wind direction. They may be very long and low in height. When sand is plenty, the regular-shaped dunes often coalesce and lose their individual characteristics. Most of the dunes in the deserts shift, and a few of them will get stabilized, especially near human habitations.
