Currency, the lifeblood of any economy, comes in two primary forms: physical notes and coins. Their acceptance as a medium of exchange hinges on their authorization by the government. This authorization, akin to a stamp of approval, makes them legal tender, meaning they cannot be refused by any citizen for settling transactions. An everyday example would be using a 100 rupee note to pay for groceries at a supermarket. The cashier cannot legally refuse this form of payment as it is recognized as a valid medium of exchange by the Indian government.

These government-backed notes and coins are often referred to as "fiat money," a term derived from their lack of intrinsic value. Unlike gold or other commodities, their worth is not tied to the material they are made of but to the trust and confidence placed in the issuing government. Take the 500 rupee note for instance, its value lies not in the paper it's printed on, but in its acceptance for goods and services across the country.

In India, the issuance of currency is a shared responsibility. The Government of India mints and distributes all coins, as well as the one rupee note. The remaining denominations, from two rupees upwards, are issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on behalf of the central government. This division of labor ensures a smooth and efficient circulation of currency throughout the nation.

Money, however, doesn't just exist in physical form. It also resides as deposits within banks. These deposits are broadly categorized into two types: demand deposits and term deposits. Demand deposits, typically held in savings or current accounts, can be withdrawn at any time by the account holder. This could be through ATM withdrawals, online transfers, or even over-the-counter transactions at a bank branch.

Term deposits, on the other hand, are fixed for a specific duration. Examples include fixed deposits (FDs) or recurring deposits (RDs). Here, the depositor agrees to keep their money in the bank for a predetermined period in exchange for a higher interest rate. Early withdrawal of these deposits often incurs a penalty, making them less liquid than demand deposits.

A unique instrument within the banking system is the cheque. Essentially a written order to the bank, it instructs the transfer of a specified amount from the drawer's account to the payee's account. While cheques drawn on current accounts are generally accepted, those drawn on savings accounts can sometimes be refused. This caveat stems from the fact that savings accounts are primarily designed for saving, not for frequent transactions. As a result, while demand deposits through cheques are generally accepted, they are not considered legal tender like physical currency.

Understanding the different forms and functions of currency is key to navigating the financial landscape. Whether it's the coins in your pocket, the deposits in your bank account, or the cheque you write to pay a bill, each plays a crucial role in facilitating economic activity. By understanding how these different elements interact, we gain a deeper appreciation for the complex and fascinating world of money.
