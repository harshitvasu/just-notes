Money supply, a stock variable, quantifies the total money circulating within the public domain at a given time. This metric is segmented into distinct categories to capture different levels of liquidity and accessibility.

M1, representing the most liquid form of money, encompasses currency in the form of notes and coins held by the public, along with net demand deposits held by commercial banks. Net demand deposits exclude interbank deposits, focusing solely on public deposits, thus providing a more accurate representation of money readily available for transactions. For instance, the cash in your wallet and the balance in your checking account contribute to M1.

M2 expands upon M1 by incorporating savings deposits held in post office savings banks. These deposits, though slightly less liquid than demand deposits, remain relatively accessible for spending.

M3, often referred to as broad money, encompasses M1 and net time deposits held in commercial banks. Time deposits, such as fixed deposits, offer higher interest rates but have restricted access compared to demand or savings deposits.

M4, the broadest measure of money supply, includes M3 and total deposits with post office savings organizations, excluding National Savings Certificates. This aggregate encompasses a wider range of financial assets, reflecting a more comprehensive view of money in the economy.

M1 and M2 are collectively referred to as narrow money, while M3 and M4 are categorized as broad money. Understanding these classifications is crucial for policymakers and economists to gauge the liquidity and potential impact of money supply on the economy.

Within these measures, M1 is the most liquid, facilitating immediate transactions, while M4 is the least liquid due to the restricted nature of some of its components. M3, the most commonly used measure of money supply, also known as aggregate monetary resources, provides a balance between liquidity and broader financial holdings.

The currency issued by the central bank, whether held by the public or commercial banks, is called high-powered money, reserve money, or monetary base. This term signifies its importance in underpinning the banking system's ability to create credit and expand the money supply.

The liquidity of assets follows a descending order: currency, demand deposits, savings deposits, and finally, time deposits. Currency offers the most immediate spending power, while time deposits, despite their higher returns, require a waiting period for withdrawal.

Understanding the nuances of money supply measures enables a comprehensive analysis of the financial landscape. By examining the composition and liquidity of different money aggregates, policymakers and economists can make informed decisions about monetary policy, interest rates, and overall economic management.
