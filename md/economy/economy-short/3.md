The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), established in 1935, serves as India's central bank, fulfilling crucial functions in the nation's economic landscape. These functions encompass:

Currency Issuance and Money Supply Control: The RBI is solely responsible for issuing currency notes and managing the money supply. It employs tools like the bank rate (the interest rate at which it lends to commercial banks) and reserve ratios (the percentage of deposits banks must hold as reserves) to regulate the flow of money and maintain price stability. For instance, increasing the reserve ratio reduces the amount of money banks can lend, thus curbing inflation.

Banker to the Government: The RBI acts as the government's banker, managing its accounts, providing financial advice, and facilitating government borrowing through the sale of treasury bills and bonds. This role ensures the smooth functioning of government finances.

Banker of Banks: As the banker to commercial banks, the RBI maintains their deposits, provides them with loans when needed, and offers guidance on monetary matters. This function supports the stability and liquidity of the banking system. For example, during financial crises, the RBI acts as a lender of last resort, providing emergency funding to prevent bank failures.

Lender of Last Resort: The RBI plays a critical role as a lender of last resort, offering financial assistance to banks and other eligible institutions facing financial distress. This backstop function helps maintain confidence in the financial system and prevents systemic risks.

Custodian of Foreign Exchange Reserves: The RBI manages India's foreign exchange reserves, which are vital for maintaining external stability and meeting international payment obligations. These reserves can be used to intervene in foreign exchange markets to stabilize the rupee's value.

The Governor of the RBI, appointed based on the recommendation of the Financial Sector Regulatory Appointments Search Committee (FSRASC), holds a pivotal position in the Indian financial system. While there are no specific qualifications mandated for the Governor by the RBI Act of 1934, the appointment and removal of the Governor are at the discretion of the central government. Additionally, the central government has the authority to issue directions to the RBI in the public interest, highlighting the close relationship between the government and the central bank.

The RBI operates under a minimum reserve system, which mandates that a minimum value of government-held gold and foreign currencies back the currency issued. The RBI also publishes various reports and surveys, including the annual "Report on Trend and Progress of Banking in India," the half-yearly "Financial Stability Report," and the "Monetary Policy Report," providing valuable insights into the state of the Indian economy and financial sector.

Recommendations from committees like the Usha Thorat Committee, Malegam Committee, and Bimal Jalan Committee have shaped the RBI's reserve requirements and surplus distribution policy. The central bank's currency, often referred to as high-powered money or reserve money, serves as the foundation for credit creation in the economy.

Overall, the Reserve Bank of India plays a multifaceted and indispensable role in the Indian economy. Its functions encompass monetary policy formulation and implementation, regulation and supervision of the banking system, management of foreign exchange reserves, and acting as a lender of last resort. These functions are essential for maintaining price stability, promoting financial inclusion, and fostering sustainable economic growth.
