The Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), established under the DICGC Act 1961, provides insurance coverage for bank deposits. It covers various types of deposits like savings, fixed, current, and recurring deposits up to a limit of ₹500,000 per depositor per bank. This means that if a bank fails, each depositor is insured up to ₹500,000, regardless of the number of accounts they hold in that bank. The premium for this insurance is paid by the bank, not the customer, making it a valuable safety net for depositors.

Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) and Non-Scheduled Commercial Banks are the two main categories of commercial banks in India. SCBs are officially listed in the Second Schedule of the RBI Act, 1934, and are regulated under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. To qualify as an SCB, a bank must maintain a minimum paid-up capital and reserves of ₹5 lakh and operate in a manner that prioritizes the interests of its depositors.

Within the category of SCBs, there are five distinct groups: State Bank of India, Nationalized Banks, Indian Private Banks, Private Sector Foreign Banks, and Regional Rural Banks (RRBs). RRBs were established in 1975 based on the recommendations of the Narasimham Working Group to cater specifically to the financial needs of rural and semi-urban areas. They are jointly owned by the Central Government, State Government, and a sponsor bank, with the Central Government holding the majority stake.

Cooperative Banks are governed by the Co-operative Societies Act, 1904, and operate at different levels, including central, state, and primary levels. These banks play a vital role in providing financial services to various sectors, including agriculture, non-agricultural businesses, and land development. In recent times, the regulatory oversight of cooperative banks has shifted, with the National Bank for Agricultural and Rural Development (NABARD) now sharing regulatory responsibilities with the RBI and state governments.

Urban Cooperative banks, following the Banking Regulation (Amendment) Act 2020, are now under the regulatory purview of the RBI, which has the authority to supersede the powers of the registrars of cooperative societies in certain matters. These banks are allowed to raise funds through equity shares, preference shares, and debt instruments, and larger cooperative banks are subject to the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.

Differentiated banks, a concept introduced in 2013 based on the recommendations of the Nachiket Mor Committee, cater to specific customer segments and offer specialized financial services. Small Finance Banks (SFBs) are licensed under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, and primarily focus on providing credit to priority sectors and individuals with small loan requirements. Payment Banks, on the other hand, are designed to offer basic banking services like deposits and payments, with a focus on promoting financial inclusion through digital channels.

Development Banks are financial institutions that play a crucial role in supporting the economic development of a country. They provide long-term financial assistance to sectors that are vital for growth, such as infrastructure, agriculture, and small-scale industries. Examples of development banks in India include NABARD, SIDBI, EXIM Bank, National Housing Bank, MUDRA Bank, and NaBFID.
