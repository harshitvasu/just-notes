In the electoral system of the Lok Sabha, India employs a method that ensures representation both across states and within individual constituencies. This system is based on the division of each state into territorial constituencies, ensuring a fair and equitable distribution of parliamentary seats. One key principle upheld by the Constitution is the principle of uniformity of representation, both between different states and within the same state. This means that each constituency, regardless of its location within a state, is allocated seats in a manner that reflects its population size and demographic composition.

Additionally, while the Constitution has moved away from communal representation, it still mandates the reservation of seats for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes in the Lok Sabha based on population ratios. These reserved seats are contested by candidates from these communities but are elected by all voters in the constituency, promoting inclusivity and integration in the electoral process. Furthermore, members belonging to scheduled castes and tribes are not restricted from contesting general (non-reserved) seats, thus ensuring equal opportunities for political participation.

To maintain stability and prevent frequent reallocations of parliamentary seats, the 42nd Amendment Act of 1976 froze the allocation of seats in the Lok Sabha to the states and the division of each state into territorial constituencies until the year 2000, based on the 1971 census data. This freeze aimed to encourage population limiting measures and prevent sudden shifts in political power due to demographic changes. Subsequently, the 84th Amendment Act of 2001 extended this ban on readjustment for another 25 years, up to the year 2026, with the same objective of promoting stability and population control.

Moreover, the electoral landscape witnessed a significant change with the passage of the 61st Constitutional Amendment Act in 1988, which reduced the voting age from 21 to 18 years. This alteration expanded the scope of political participation, enabling a larger segment of the population to exercise their democratic right. This move not only increased the number of eligible voters but also empowered youth to actively engage in the electoral process, thereby enriching the democratic fabric of the nation.

In essence, the system of elections to the Lok Sabha reflects India's commitment to democratic principles, inclusivity, and stability. By ensuring uniform representation across states, providing for reserved seats for marginalized communities, and adapting to demographic shifts through legislative measures, India's electoral system strives to uphold the ideals of fairness, equality, and participation in the world's largest democracy.
