In India's parliamentary system, the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha serve as two essential pillars of legislative governance, each with its unique composition, roles, and functions. The Rajya Sabha, often referred to as the Council of States, boasts a maximum strength of 250 members, with 238 elected indirectly by state legislative assemblies and 12 nominated by the President, typically from distinguished fields such as art, literature, science, and social service. Currently, the Rajya Sabha comprises 245 members, including representatives from states, union territories, and presidential nominees. The allocation of seats to states and union territories is outlined in the 4th Schedule of the Constitution, with only select territories like Delhi, Puducherry, and Jammu and Kashmir having representation in this chamber.

Conversely, the Lok Sabha, known as the House of the People, has a maximum strength of 550 members, comprising 530 from states and 20 from union territories. However, its present strength stands at 543, with the recent discontinuation of the nomination of two Anglo-Indian members by the President, a provision abolished by the 104th Constitutional Amendment Act of 2019. Members of the Lok Sabha are directly elected from territorial constituencies based on the universal adult franchise system, where candidates securing the highest number of votes win the seat. Additionally, representatives from union territories are chosen through direct elections as prescribed by the Union Territories (Direct Election to the House of the People) Act, 1965.

In terms of member selection, the Rajya Sabha employs a method of proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote, where elected MLAs nominate members based on proportional representation according to each state's population. Similarly, representatives from union territories in the Rajya Sabha are indirectly elected by an electoral college constituted for this purpose. On the other hand, members of the Lok Sabha are directly elected by voters in their respective constituencies using the first-past-the-post system.

One notable difference between the two chambers lies in their continuity and terms of office. The Rajya Sabha operates as a continuing chamber, with one-third of its members retiring every two years. The term of office for a Rajya Sabha member spans six years, with retiring members eligible for re-election and re-nomination. In contrast, the Lok Sabha is not a continuing chamber and has a fixed term of five years from the date of its first meeting after general elections, after which it automatically dissolves. However, its term can be extended for up to one year at a time during a national emergency, subject to parliamentary legislation.

In summary, while both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha serve as integral components of India's parliamentary democracy, they exhibit distinct characteristics in terms of composition, member selection, continuity, and terms of office. These differences reflect the nuanced approach to representation and governance in India's federal structure, ensuring a balanced and effective system of legislative oversight and decision-making.
