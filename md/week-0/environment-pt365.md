## Climate Change

### Global Scenario

#### Recent Findings on the Ozone Hole

A recent study reveals that between **2020 and 2022**, the **ozone hole over Antarctica** has grown both larger and thinner. This development has raised concerns about the atmospheric conditions and the factors contributing to such changes.

#### **Understanding the Ozone Layer and Ozone Hole**

The **ozone layer** is a thin shield of gas situated in the **Earth’s stratosphere**. It plays a crucial role in absorbing the **sun’s ultraviolet (UV) rays**. Approximately **90% of the Earth's ozone** resides in this layer.

The **ozone hole** refers to a region of exceptionally depleted ozone within the stratosphere over the **Antarctic and Arctic**. This phenomenon is characterized by areas where **ozone levels drop below 220 Dobson Units (DU)**, compared to the average thickness of the ozone layer over Earth, which is about **300 Dobson Units**.

#### **Ozone-Depleting Substances (ODSs)**

**Ozone-depleting substances (ODSs)** are human-made gases that ascend to the stratosphere and repeatedly break apart ozone molecules through a process known as **catalytic cycles**. This cycle involves a sequence of chemical reactions that occur in a loop, resulting in the destruction of ozone. Major ODSs include **chlorine, bromine, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)**, carbon tetrachloride, and halons. Despite these challenges, the **United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)** has reported that the ozone layer is on track to recover within the next **four decades**.

#### **Potential Drivers of the Ozone Hole over Antarctica**

Several factors contribute to the enlargement and thinning of the ozone hole over Antarctica:

**Changes in the Antarctic Polar Vortex** The **Antarctic polar vortex** consists of stratospheric wind patterns characterized by a vast swirl of low pressure and extremely cold air, which is more pronounced over the **South Pole**. This leads to the formation of **Polar Stratospheric Clouds (PSCs)**. These clouds, also known as nacreous clouds or mother-of-pearl clouds, form at temperatures below **\-78°C** and trap outgoing longwave radiation. They contribute to ozone destruction by:

- Providing surfaces that convert benign forms of chlorine into **reactive, ozone-destroying forms**.
- Removing nitrogen compounds that normally moderate the destructive impact of chlorine.

**Changes in the Solar Cycle** Fluctuations in the **solar cycle** can also influence the size and severity of the ozone hole.

**Increased Atmospheric Abundance of Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)** A significant increase in the atmospheric abundance of **CFCs** has been identified as a critical driver in the depletion of the ozone layer over Antarctica.




#### Impact of Volcanic Eruptions on the Ozone Layer

**Recent studies** have indicated that the **eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano** may have significantly impacted the ozone layer. The **Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai** is a **submarine volcano** situated in the **Tongan archipelago** in the southern Pacific Ocean, which erupted in **January 2022**.

**Historical Context: Mt. Pinatubo Eruption** The **1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo** in the Philippines is an earlier example where volcanic activity led to considerable ozone loss in the stratosphere. This eruption injected vast quantities of sulfur dioxide (SO₂) and other gases into the stratosphere, forming sulfate aerosols that provided surfaces for chemical reactions that depleted ozone.

#### **Effects of Volcanic Eruptions on the Ozone Layer**

Volcanic eruptions impact the ozone layer in several significant ways:

**Injection of Sulfur Dioxide (SO₂)** Volcanic eruptions release large amounts of **sulfur dioxide** into the atmosphere. When this gas reaches the stratosphere, it undergoes chemical reactions to form **sulfate aerosols**. These aerosols serve as surfaces for **heterogeneous chemical reactions**, which facilitate the conversion of stable chlorine compounds into reactive chlorine species that can destroy ozone molecules.

**Formation of Polar Stratospheric Clouds (PSCs)** The sulfate aerosols produced by volcanic eruptions contribute to the formation of **polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs)**. These clouds are particularly effective in providing surfaces for reactions that convert **inert chlorine and bromine compounds** into active forms that can participate in ozone destruction, especially in the polar regions.

**Temperature Effects** Volcanic aerosols can lead to **stratospheric cooling**, which enhances the formation and persistence of PSCs. These clouds are crucial for ozone depletion, especially over the Antarctic, where they catalyze reactions that release active chlorine and bromine.

**Direct Injection of Halogens** In some cases, volcanic eruptions can directly inject **halogen gases** such as **chlorine and bromine** into the stratosphere. These gases can rapidly participate in ozone-depleting reactions, compounding the effects of already present human-made ODSs.

#### **Case Studies of Volcanic Impact**

**Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai Eruption (2022)** The eruption of the **Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano** in January 2022 likely released substantial amounts of sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere. This event has raised concerns about its potential to catalyze ozone-depleting reactions, similar to historical volcanic events.

**Mt. Pinatubo Eruption (1991)** The **1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo** in the Philippines is a well-documented case where volcanic activity led to significant ozone layer depletion. The eruption released around **20 million tons of sulfur dioxide** into the stratosphere, creating extensive sulfate aerosols that catalyzed ozone-destroying reactions, leading to measurable reductions in global ozone levels.

These examples illustrate the profound impact that volcanic eruptions can have on the stratosphere and the ozone layer, emphasizing the need for continuous monitoring and research to understand and mitigate these natural influences on our atmospheric health.

#### Montreal Protocol: Recent Developments and India's Achievements

**India** has recently been highlighted for **surpassing the targets set by the Montreal Protocol**, according to a report by the **Ministry of Environment** and the **United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)**.

#### **India’s Achievements under the Montreal Protocol**

**Exceeding the HCFC Phase-Out Goal** India has exceeded the **35% HCFC (Hydrochlorofluorocarbons) phase-out goal** by achieving a **44% reduction from the 2020 baseline**. This significant achievement underscores the country's commitment to reducing ozone-depleting substances.

**Elimination of HCFC 141b** India has successfully eliminated the use of **HCFC 141b**, which is commonly used as a blowing agent in the production of **rigid polyurethane foam** and as a refrigerant in new equipment. This step is crucial in mitigating the harmful effects of these substances on the ozone layer.

**Future Goals for HCFC Phase-Out** India plans to **completely phase out the use of HCFCs in new equipment manufacturing by December 2024**, significantly ahead of the Montreal Protocol’s schedule of 2030.

#### **Other Significant Achievements**

**Phasing Out Controlled ODS** India has phased out the use of **CFCs (Chlorofluorocarbons), carbon tetrachloride, halons**, and other ozone-depleting substances for controlled uses, showcasing its proactive measures in environmental conservation.

**India Cooling Action Plan (ICAP)** The **India Cooling Action Plan (ICAP)**, launched with the aim of reducing cooling demand, transitioning to eco-friendly refrigerants, enhancing energy efficiency, and adopting better technology options, aims to achieve these goals by 2037-38.

#### **About the Montreal Protocol (1987)**

**Origins and Implementation** The **Montreal Protocol** was implemented under the **Vienna Convention**, which was adopted in 1985. This global environmental treaty aims to eliminate the production and use of **ozone-depleting substances (ODS)**.

**Global Participation** The Montreal Protocol is notable for being the **first universally ratified treaty of the United Nations (UN)**. **World Ozone Day** is celebrated on **16th September** each year to commemorate the signing of this pivotal agreement.

#### **Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol**

**Adoption and Objectives** The **Kigali Amendment** to the Montreal Protocol, adopted in 2016 and entered into force in 2019, aims to phase down the production and consumption of **Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)**. While HFCs are non-ODS alternatives to CFCs and HCFCs, they possess a global warming potential thousands of times that of carbon dioxide.

**Reduction Targets** The Kigali Amendment divides nations into three groups with a **four-step path to achieve an 80% reduction in HFCs consumption by 2047**.

#### **India and the Montreal Protocol**

**Participation and Implementation** India became a party to the **Vienna Convention** in 1991 and the **Montreal Protocol** in 1992. The **Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC)** is the implementing agency responsible for these commitments.

**Ratification of the Kigali Amendment** India ratified the **Kigali Amendment** in 2021. Under this amendment, India will complete its phase-down of HFCs in **four steps from 2032 onwards**. The cumulative reduction targets are set at **10% by 2032, 20% by 2037, 30% by 2042**, and an **85% reduction by 2047**.



#### State of the Cryosphere 2023 Report

The **State of the Cryosphere 2023 – Two Degrees is Too High** report was recently released by the **International Cryosphere Climate Initiative (ICCI)**. This report highlights the alarming impacts of climate change on the cryosphere, emphasizing the urgency for immediate action to preserve these critical regions.

#### **About ICCI**

The **International Cryosphere Climate Initiative (ICCI)** is a network comprising experts and researchers dedicated to working with governments and organizations to safeguard Earth’s cryosphere. ICCI's programs target the **climate dynamics of the cryosphere**, focusing on its global implications and the potential consequences of its warming.

#### **Highlights of the Report**

**Disappearance of Glaciers and Polar Regions** The report warns that nearly **all tropical glaciers**, most **mid-latitude glaciers**, and **polar regions** are projected to disappear even if global temperatures rise by just **2°C**. The **Himalayas** are particularly vulnerable, with an expected loss of **50% of today’s ice** if global temperatures reach **2°C**.

**Ice Loss in the Last Decade** The past decade has witnessed the **seven worst years of ice loss**, underscoring the rapid acceleration of ice melt and its profound implications for global climate stability.

#### **About the Cryosphere**

The cryosphere refers to the **frozen part of the planet**, encompassing regions with snow, ice, glaciers, ice sheets, and permafrost.

**Cryosphere's Role in Global Climate**

- **Temperature Regulation**: The cryosphere plays a crucial role in regulating Earth’s temperature due to its high **albedo**—the fraction of light that a surface reflects. This reflectivity helps to keep the planet cooler by bouncing sunlight back into space.
    
- **Carbon Storage**: **Permafrost** in the cryosphere has trapped vast amounts of carbon within its soil, preventing it from entering the atmosphere and exacerbating global warming.
    
- **Water Availability**: The cryosphere holds **80% of the world's fresh water** in the form of glaciers, ice sheets, and snow packs. This stored water is essential for global water availability, particularly in regions dependent on glacial meltwater for freshwater supply.
    

**Consequences of Ice Melt**

The melting of ice in the cryosphere leads to **extreme weather events** and **sea level rise**. These changes can result in more frequent and severe storms, flooding, and disruptions to global weather patterns, impacting ecosystems and human societies.

#### **India’s Initiatives to Protect the Cryosphere**

India has undertaken several initiatives to protect its cryosphere:

- **National Mission for Sustaining the Himalayan Ecosystem**: This mission aims to safeguard the fragile Himalayan ecosystem, which is crucial for India's climate and water resources.
    
- **Centre for Himalayan Glaciology**: Established within the **Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology**, this center focuses on studying and understanding the dynamics of Himalayan glaciers to develop strategies for their preservation.
    

These efforts reflect India’s commitment to addressing the challenges posed by climate change and protecting its vital cryospheric regions. The findings of the **State of the Cryosphere 2023** report serve as a critical reminder of the urgent need for global action to mitigate climate change and preserve the cryosphere for future generations.



#### ICE MELT IN WEST ANTARCTICA

Accelerated **ice melt in West Antarctica** has been a significant concern, identified through extensive studies and sophisticated computer simulations. The complete loss of the **West Antarctic ice sheet** could potentially contribute to a catastrophic sea level rise of up to 5 meters. The primary driver of this melting is the **ocean-driven melting of floating ice shelves** in the **Amundsen Sea**, located off the coast of West Antarctica. This process initiates a sequence of events that exacerbate the ice loss and accelerate sea level rise.

The sequence begins with the melting that causes the **retreat of the grounding line**—the line where the ice initially begins to float. As the grounding line retreats, the resistance to ice flowing across it diminishes. This reduction in resistance leads to a faster flow of ice near the grounding line, which in turn causes more horizontal stretching and subsequent thinning of the ice. This thinning creates **steeper surface slopes**, increasing the stress that propels the ice forward. As the flow speeds up inland, thinning propagates further into the interior of the ice sheet, significantly increasing the ice sheet's contribution to sea level rise.

**Global efforts to safeguard Antarctica** have been ongoing for decades. The **Antarctic Treaty**, signed in 1959, aims to demilitarize Antarctica and promote international scientific cooperation, with **India** being one of the signatory members. The **Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals**, established in 1972, and the **Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources**, ratified in 1982 by India, are crucial frameworks for protecting the region's unique ecosystem. Furthermore, the **Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty**, known as the **Madrid Protocol**, signed in 1991, underscores global commitments to environmental preservation.

India has played a significant role in Antarctic research and conservation through its **Indian Antarctic Program**, initiated in 1981. India has established three research base stations in Antarctica: **Dakshin Gangotri** in 1983, **Maitri** in 1988, and **Bharati** in 2012. Currently, **Maitri and Bharati are fully operational**, contributing to significant scientific research and monitoring. In 2022, India enacted the **Antarctic Act** to align with the Antarctic Treaty, the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, and the Protocol on Environmental Protection. Key provisions of this Act include the establishment of the **Committee on Antarctic Governance and Environmental Protection**, a **permit system**, the constitution of an **Antarctic fund**, imposition of **stringent penalties**, and the designation of a court to try offenses related to Antarctic governance and environmental protection.

ARCTIC AMPLIFICATION Why in the News? World Metrological Organisation (WMO) study highlighted that Arctic has warmed twice as much as world average.

#### ARCTIC AMPLIFICATION

A recent study by the **World Meteorological Organization (WMO)** has highlighted that the Arctic region is warming at a rate twice that of the global average. This phenomenon, known as **Arctic Amplification**, refers to the significant warming differential between the poles and the tropics. Some studies have even indicated that the Arctic has warmed nearly four times faster than the rest of the world since 1979.

Several factors contribute to the accelerated warming in the Arctic. **Polar amplification** is notably stronger in the Arctic than in Antarctica due to distinct geographical and environmental differences. The Arctic is an ocean covered by sea ice, which melts to expose more land and water to the Sun, leading to increased absorption of sunlight. In contrast, Antarctica is an elevated continent with a more stable ice and snow cover. Additionally, prevailing air circulation systems transfer heat from the tropics to the poles, further exacerbating the warming in the Arctic.

**Summer Arctic sea ice extent** is shrinking by 12.6% per decade due to global warming. The reduction in ice cover has profound implications for the Earth's climate and energy balance. Arctic sea ice plays a critical role in maintaining the polar regions' cool temperatures and the overall energy balance of the Earth. It acts as a barrier between the cold air above and the relatively warmer water below, keeping the air cool. As the ice diminishes, this barrier weakens, leading to further warming.

The changes in Arctic sea ice also have significant ecological and socio-cultural impacts. The decline in ice affects biodiversity, particularly species such as **polar bears and walruses**, which rely on the ice for hunting and habitat. The traditional subsistence hunting lifestyles of **indigenous populations** such as the **Yup’ik, Iñupiat, and Inuit** are also threatened as their hunting grounds become less accessible.

Moreover, the reduction in ice cover has economic and geopolitical implications. **Reduced ice can open up new shipping lanes**, making maritime navigation in the Arctic more feasible and potentially reducing shipping times and costs. It also increases access to natural resources in the region, including oil, gas, and minerals, leading to heightened interest and potential exploitation by various countries.

Overall, Arctic Amplification is a stark indicator of the broader impacts of climate change, illustrating how rapidly and profoundly environmental changes can occur in sensitive regions, affecting both natural ecosystems and human societies.

Blue Ocean event • Refers to a situation in which the Arctic Ocean’s ice area drops below 1 Million Sq.Km leading to the change of arctic surface colour from white to blue. • Process reduces the amount of sunlight reflected into space, leading to further warming and ice loss.



#### Blue Ocean Event

A **Blue Ocean event** refers to a critical situation in which the **Arctic Ocean’s ice area drops below 1 million square kilometers**. This drastic reduction in ice cover leads to a significant transformation of the Arctic surface color from white to blue, fundamentally altering the region's albedo, or reflectivity.

The process of a Blue Ocean event involves a feedback loop that exacerbates the warming and ice loss in the Arctic. When the ice melts, the highly reflective white ice surface, which used to reflect a substantial portion of sunlight back into space, is replaced by the darker blue ocean water. This darker surface absorbs more sunlight, rather than reflecting it, leading to further warming of the ocean.

This increased absorption of sunlight results in a positive feedback mechanism: as the water warms, it accelerates the melting of the remaining ice. This, in turn, exposes even more dark ocean water, which absorbs even more heat, perpetuating the cycle of warming and ice loss. This phenomenon contributes significantly to **Arctic Amplification**, where the region warms at a much faster rate compared to the global average.

The implications of a Blue Ocean event are profound. Beyond contributing to global sea level rise, it significantly impacts global weather patterns and the overall climate system. The reduction in ice cover can disrupt the Arctic's role in regulating temperatures and can lead to more extreme weather conditions in the Northern Hemisphere.

Furthermore, the ecological consequences are severe. The loss of ice affects the habitats of many Arctic species, including polar bears, seals, and various marine organisms that depend on ice-covered waters for survival. It also impacts the traditional lifestyles of indigenous communities who rely on sea ice for hunting and transportation.

In summary, a **Blue Ocean event** not only signals a dramatic shift in the Arctic environment but also underscores the broader impacts of climate change, illustrating how interconnected and sensitive our global systems are to changes in the Arctic.

### International Conferences, Conventions and Initiatives

#### 28TH CONFERENCE OF THE PARTIES (COP28)

The **28th Conference of the Parties (COP28)** of the **United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)** recently took place in **Dubai, UAE**. These annual conferences are critical gatherings where member countries discuss and strategize on ways to address the escalating climate crisis. One of the primary objectives of COP meetings is to review the **Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)** submitted by member countries under the **Paris Agreement** of 2015, which detail each country's efforts to reduce national emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change.

During **COP28**, the final document adopted was known as the **UAE Consensus**, marking a significant step forward in international climate negotiations. Looking ahead, **Azerbaijan** and **Brazil** are set to host **COP29** in 2024 and **COP30** in 2025, respectively.

The **UNFCCC** is an international environmental treaty with the primary goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to prevent global warming. The treaty was signed in 1992 at the **United Nations Conference on Environment and Development**, commonly referred to as the **Earth Summit**, held in Rio de Janeiro. The UNFCCC is headquartered in **Bonn, Germany**, where its secretariat operates, and it includes **197 parties**, among them **India**.

Among the key agreements under the UNFCCC is the **Paris Agreement**, adopted in 2015, which is legally binding and aims to keep the global average temperature increase well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, with concerted efforts to limit the rise to 1.5°C. Another crucial agreement is the **Kyoto Protocol**, adopted in 1997 and entering into force in 2005, which committed industrialized countries and economies in transition to specific targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The commitments under the Kyoto Protocol concluded in 2020.

One notable initiative by the UNFCCC Secretariat is **Momentum for Change: Climate Neutral Now**, which encourages **individuals, companies, and governments** to achieve climate neutrality through three steps: measuring the climate footprint, reducing emissions, and offsetting any remaining emissions. This initiative underscores the comprehensive approach required to tackle climate change, involving meticulous measurement, proactive reduction efforts, and compensatory actions to balance any residual emissions.

The ongoing efforts and commitments highlighted during COP28 and through the UNFCCC's various initiatives reflect the global community's recognition of the urgent need to address climate change through collaborative and sustained action.



#### Pillars of COP28 Key Outcomes

The **28th Conference of the Parties (COP28)** emphasized several critical pillars and achieved notable outcomes, particularly in the areas of climate finance, focusing on people, lives, and livelihoods, and ensuring full inclusivity.

**Fixing Climate Finance**

A significant achievement of COP28 was the **operationalization of the Loss and Damage (L&D) Fund**, which was first announced during **COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt** in 2022. This fund is designed to compensate countries already grappling with the severe impacts of climate change. **Loss and Damage (L&D)** refer to the adverse consequences stemming from unavoidable climate risks such as rising sea levels, heatwaves, and crop failures. The **Warsaw International Mechanism (WIM)** for L&D was established at **COP19 in Warsaw, Poland** in 2013 to address these issues in developing countries. The fund will be administered by the **World Bank** as a World Bank-hosted Financial Intermediary Fund for an interim period of four years but managed by an independent secretariat. Several countries, including **UAE, Germany, UK, and Japan**, have pledged financial contributions to this fund.

In addition to the L&D Fund, COP28 saw the mobilization of **$83.9 billion** directed towards various climate finance mechanisms such as the **Green Climate Fund, Adaptation Fund, Least Developed Countries Fund, and Special Climate Change Fund**. Moreover, the conference produced a **Declaration on a Global Climate Finance Framework**, with **India** being a part of this significant declaration.

**Focusing on People, Lives, and Livelihoods**

The first **implementation report of the Sharm el-Sheikh Adaptation Agenda (SAA)** was released at COP28, highlighting progress and future steps in adaptation. The **COP28 UAE Declaration on Agriculture, Food, & Climate** and the **COP28 UAE Declaration on Climate and Health** were other crucial documents released. The latter was produced in partnership with the **World Health Organization (WHO)** and was signed by over 120 countries, including the **US, UK, and Brazil**; however, **India** has not yet signed this declaration.

Another important outcome was the **COP28 UAE Declaration on Climate Relief, Recovery & Peace**. The conference also saw the adoption of the **Global Goal on Adaptation-UAE Framework for Global Climate Resilience**, which guides long-term adaptation efforts within the context of the temperature goal set out in Article 2 of the **Paris Agreement**. This goal is a collective commitment under **Article 7.1 of the Paris Agreement**, aimed at enhancing the world’s adaptive capacity, strengthening resilience, and reducing vulnerability to climate change.

**Underpinning Everything with Full Inclusivity**

COP28 introduced the **Gender-Responsive Just Transitions and Climate Action Partnership**, a significant step towards ensuring that gender considerations are central to climate action. Additionally, the appointment of the **Youth Climate Champion** aims to bridge the gap between the COP Presidency and youth stakeholders, ensuring that young voices are adequately represented in the climate dialogue.

These key outcomes from COP28 demonstrate a comprehensive approach to addressing the multifaceted challenges posed by climate change, emphasizing financial mechanisms, adaptation efforts, and inclusive policies to ensure that no segment of society is left behind in the global fight against climate change.
