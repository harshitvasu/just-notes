<h1 id="election">ELECTION </h1>
<p>The Vice-President, like the president, is elected not directly by<br>
the people but by the method of indirect election. He is elected by<br>
the members of an electoral college consisting of the members of<br>
both Houses of Parliament.1 Thus, this electoral college is<br>
different from the electoral college for the election of the President<br>
in the following two respects:</p>
<ol>
<li>It consists of both elected and nominated members of the<br>
Parliament (in the case of president, only elected members).</li>
<li>It does not include the members of the state legislative<br>
assemblies (in the case of President, the elected members<br>
of the state legislative assemblies are included). Explaining<br>
the reason for this difference, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar observed:2<br>
“The President is the head of the State and his power extends<br>
both to the administration by the Centre as well as to the states.<br>
Consequently, it is necessary that in his election, not only<br>
members of Parliament should play their part, but the members of<br>
the state legislatures should have a voice. But, when we come to<br>
the Vice-President, his normal functions are to preside over the<br>
council of states. It is only on a rare occasion, and that too for a<br>
temporary period, that he may be called upon to assume the<br>
duties of the president. That being so, it does not seem necessary<br>
that the members of the state legislatures should also be invited to<br>
take part in the election of the Vice-President”.<br>
But, the manner of election is same in both the cases. Thus,<br>
the Vice-President’s election, like that of the President’s election,<br>
is held in accordance with the system of proportional<br>
representation by means of the single transferable vote and the<br>
voting is by secret ballot.3<br>
All doubts and disputes in connection with election of the Vice-<br>
President are inquired into and decided by the Supreme Court<br>
whose decision is final. The election of a person as Vice-President<br>
cannot be challenged on the ground that the electoral college was<br>
incomplete (i.e., existence of any vacancy among the members of<br>
electoral college). If the election of a person as VicePresident is<br>
declared void by the Supreme Court, acts done by him before the<br>
date of such declaration of the Supreme Court are not invalidated<br>
(i.e., they continue to remain in force).</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="qualifications--oath-and--conditions">QUALIFICATIONS,  OATH AND  CONDITIONS </h1>
<p>Qualifications<br>
To be eligible for election as Vice-President, a person should fulfil<br>
the following qualifications:</p>
<ol>
<li>He should be a citizen of India.</li>
<li>He should have completed 35 years of age.</li>
<li>He should be qualified for election as a member of the Rajya<br>
Sabha.</li>
<li>He should not hold any office of profit under the Union<br>
government or any state government or any local authority<br>
or any other public authority.</li>
</ol>
<p>But, a sitting President or Vice-President of the Union, the<br>
governor of any state and a minister for the Union or any state is<br>
not deemed to hold any office of profit and hence qualified for<br>
being a candidate for Vice-President.<br>
Further, the nomination of a candidate for election to the office<br>
of Vice-President must be subscribed by at least 20 electors as<br>
proposers and 20 electors as seconders. Every candidate has to<br>
make a security deposit of ₹15,000 in the Reserve Bank of India.4<br>
Oath or Affirmation<br>
Before entering upon his office, the VicePresident has to make<br>
and subscribe to an oath or affirmation. In his oath, the<br>
VicePresident swears:</p>
<ol>
<li>to bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India;<br>
and</li>
<li>to faithfully discharge the duties of his office.<br>
The oath of office to the Vice-President is administered by the<br>
President or some person appointed in that behalf by him.<br>
Conditions of Office<br>
The Constitution lays down the following two conditions of the<br>
Vice-President’s office:</li>
<li>He should not be a member of either House of Parliament or<br>
a House of the state legislature. If any such person is<br>
elected Vice-President, he is deemed to have vacated his<br>
seat in that House on the date on which he enters upon his<br>
office as Vice-President.</li>
<li>He should not hold any other office of profit.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="term-and--vacancy">TERM AND  VACANCY </h1>
<p>Term of Office<br>
The Vice-President holds office for a term of five years from the<br>
date on which he enters upon his office. However, he can resign<br>
from his office at any time by addressing the resignation letter to<br>
the President. He can also be removed from the office before<br>
completion of his term. A formal impeachment is not required for<br>
his removal. He can be removed by a resolution passed by a<br>
majority of all the then members of the Rajya Sabha and agreed<br>
to by the Lok Sabha. This means that this resolution should be<br>
passed in the Rajya Sabha by an effective majority and in the Lok<br>
Sabha by a simple majority. It must be noted here that the<br>
effective majority in India is only a type of special majority and not<br>
a separate one. Further, this resolution can be introduced only in<br>
the Rajya Sabha and not in the Lok Sabha. But, no such<br>
resolution can be moved unless at least 14 days’ advance notice<br>
has been given. Notably, no ground has been mentioned in the<br>
Constitution for his removal.<br>
The Vice-President can hold office beyond his term of five<br>
years until his successor assumes charge. He is also eligible for<br>
reelection to that office. He may be elected for any number of<br>
terms.5<br>
Vacancy in Office<br>
A vacancy in the Vice-President’s office can occur in any of the<br>
following ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the expiry of his tenure of five years.</li>
<li>By his resignation.</li>
<li>On his removal.</li>
<li>By his death.6</li>
<li>Otherwise, for example, when he becomes disqualified to<br>
hold office or when his election is declared void.<br>
When the vacancy is going to be caused by the expiration of<br>
the term of the sitting vicepresident, an election to fill the vacancy<br>
must be held before the expiration of the term.<br>
If the office falls vacant by resignation, removal, death or<br>
otherwise, then election to fill the vacancy should be held as soon<br>
as possible after the occurrence of the vacancy. The newlyelected<br>
vice-president remains in office for a full term of five years<br>
from the date he assumes charge of his office.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="powers-and--functions">POWERS AND  FUNCTIONS </h1>
<p>The functions of Vice-President are two-fold:</p>
<ol>
<li>He acts as the ex-officio Chairman of Rajya Sabha. In this<br>
capacity, his powers and functions are similar to those of the<br>
Speaker of Lok Sabha. In this respect, he resembles the<br>
American vicepresident who also acts as the Chairman of<br>
the Senate–the Upper House of the American legislature.</li>
<li>He acts as President when a vacancy occurs in the office of<br>
the President due to his resignation, impeachment, death or<br>
otherwise.7 He can act as President only for a maximum<br>
period of six months within which a new President has to be<br>
elected. Further, when the sitting President is unable to<br>
discharge his functions due to absence, illness or any other<br>
cause, the Vice-President discharges his functions until the<br>
President resumes his office.8<br>
While acting as President or discharging the functions of<br>
President, the Vice-President does not perform the duties of the<br>
office of the chairman of Rajya Sabha. During this period, those<br>
duties are performed by the Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha.<br>
The Constitution has not fixed any emoluments for the Vice-<br>
President in that capacity. He draws his regular salary in his<br>
capacity as the ex-officio Chairman of the Rajya Sabha. In 2018,<br>
the Parliament increased the salary of the Chairman of the Rajya<br>
Sabha from ₹1.25 lakh to ₹4 lakh per month9. Earlier in 2008, the<br>
pension of the retired Vice-President was increased from ₹20,000<br>
per month to 50% of his salary per month10. In addition, he is<br>
entitled to daily allowance, free furnished residence, medical,<br>
travel and other facilities.<br>
During any period when the Vice-President acts as President or<br>
discharges the functions of the President, he is not entitled to the<br>
salary or allowance payable to the Chairman of Rajya Sabha, but<br>
the salary and allowance of the President.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="indian-and--american--vice-presidents">INDIAN AND  AMERICAN  VICE PRESIDENTS </h1>
<h1 id="compared">COMPARED </h1>
<p>Though the office of the Indian VicePresident is modelled on the<br>
lines of the American Vice-President, there is a difference. The<br>
American Vice-President succeeds to the presidency when it falls<br>
vacant, and remains President for the unexpired term of his<br>
predecessor. The Indian Vice-President, on the other hand, does<br>
not assume the office of the President when it falls vacant for the<br>
unexpired term. He merely serves as an acting President until the<br>
new President assumes charge.<br>
From the above it is clear that the Constitution has not<br>
assigned any significant function to the Vice-President in that<br>
capacity. Hence, some scholars call him ‘His Superfluous<br>
Highness’. This office was created with a view to maintain the<br>
political continuity of the Indian State.</p>

I<br>
19 Prime Minister<br>
n the scheme of parliamentary system of government provided<br>
by the constitution, the President is the nominal executive<br>
authority (de jure executive) and Prime Minister is the real<br>
executive authority (de facto executive). In other words, president<br>
is the head of the State while Prime Minister is the head of the<br>
government.</p>
<h1 id="appointment-of-the--prime--minister">APPOINTMENT OF THE  PRIME  MINISTER </h1>
<p>The Constitution does not contain any specific procedure for the<br>
selection and appointment of the Prime Minister. Article 75 says<br>
only that the Prime Minister shall be appointed by the president.<br>
However, this does not imply that the president is free to appoint<br>
any one as the Prime Minister. In accordance with the conventions<br>
of the parliamentary system of government, the President has to<br>
appoint the leader of the majority party in the Lok Sabha as the<br>
Prime Minister. But, when no party has a clear majority in the Lok<br>
Sabha, then the President may exercise his personal discretion in<br>
the selection and appointment of the Prime Minister. In such a<br>
situation, the President usually appoints the leader of the largest<br>
party or coalition in the Lok Sabha as the Prime Minister and asks<br>
him to seek a vote of confidence in the House within a month.<br>
This discretion was exercised by the President, for the first time in<br>
1979, when Neelam Sanjiva Reddy (the then President) appointed<br>
Charan Singh (the coalition leader) as the Prime Minister after the<br>
fall of the Janata Party government headed by Morarji Desai.<br>
There is also one more situation when the president may have<br>
to exercise his individual judgement in the selection and<br>
appointment of the Prime Minister, that is, when the Prime<br>
Minister in office dies suddenly and there is no obvious successor.<br>
This is what happened when Indira Gandhi was assassinated in<br>
1984. The then President Zail Singh appointed Rajiv Gandhi as<br>
the Prime Minister by ignoring the precedent of appointing a<br>
caretaker Prime Minister.1 Later on, the Congress parliamentary<br>
party unanimously elected him as its leader. However, if, on the<br>
death of an incumbent Prime Minister, the ruling party elects a<br>
new leader, the President has no choice but to appoint him as<br>
Prime Minister.<br>
In 1980, the Delhi High Court held that the Constitution does<br>
not require that a person must prove his majority in the Lok Sabha<br>
before he is appointed as the Prime Minister. The President may<br>
first appoint him the Prime Minister and then ask him to prove his<br>
majority in the Lok Sabha within a reasonable period. For<br>
example, Charan Singh (1979), V.P. Singh (1989), Chandrasekhar<br>
(1990), P.V. Narasimha Rao (1991), A.B. Vajyapee (1996), Deve<br>
Gowda (1996), I.K. Gujral (1997) and again A.B. Vajpayee (1998)<br>
were appointed as Prime Ministers in this way.<br>
In 1997, the Supreme Court held that a person who is not a<br>
member of either House of Parliament can be appointed as Prime<br>
Minister for six months, within which, he should become a<br>
member of either House of Parliament; otherwise, he ceases to be<br>
the Prime Minister.<br>
Constitutionally, the Prime Minister may be a member of any of<br>
the two Houses of parliament. For example, three Prime Ministers,<br>
Indira Gandhi (1966), Deve Gowda (1996) and Manmohan Singh<br>
(2004), were members of the Rajya Sabha. In Britain, on the other<br>
hand, the Prime Minister should definitely be a member of the<br>
Lower House (House of Commons).</p>
<h1 id="oath--term-and--salary">OATH,  TERM AND  SALARY </h1>
<p>Before the Prime Minister enters upon his office, the president<br>
administers to him the oaths of office and secrecy.2 In his oath of<br>
office, the Prime Minister swears:</p>
<ol>
<li>to bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India,</li>
<li>to uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India,</li>
<li>to faithfully and conscientiously discharge the duties of his<br>
office, and</li>
<li>to do right to all manner of people in accordance with the<br>
Constitution and the law, without fear or favour, affection or<br>
ill will.<br>
In his oath of secrecy, the Prime Minister swears that he will not<br>
directly or indirectly communicate or reveal to any person(s) any<br>
matter that is brought under his consideration or becomes known<br>
to him as a Union Minister except as may be required for the due<br>
discharge of his duties as such minister.<br>
The term of the Prime Minister is not fixed and he holds office<br>
during the pleasure of the president. However, this does not mean<br>
that the president can dismiss the Prime Minister at any time. So<br>
long as the Prime Minister enjoys the majority support in the Lok<br>
Sabha, he cannot be dismissed by the President. However, if he<br>
loses the confidence of the Lok Sabha, he must resign or the<br>
President can dismiss him.3<br>
The salary and allowances of the Prime Minister are<br>
determined by the Parliament from time to time. He gets the<br>
salary and allowances that are payable to a member of<br>
Parliament. Additionally, he gets a sumptuary allowance, free<br>
accommodation, travelling allowance, medical facilities, etc. In<br>
2001, the Parliament increased his sumptuary allowance from<br>
₹1,500 to ₹3,000 per month.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="powers-and--functions-of-the--prime">POWERS AND  FUNCTIONS OF THE  PRIME </h1>
<h1 id="minister">MINISTER </h1>
<p>The powers and functions of Prime Minister can be studied under<br>
the following heads:<br>
In Relation to Council of Ministers<br>
The Prime Minister enjoys the following powers as head of the<br>
Union council of ministers:</p>
<ol>
<li>He recommends persons who can be appointed as ministers<br>
by the president. The President can appoint only those<br>
persons as ministers who are recommended by the Prime<br>
Minister.</li>
<li>He allocates and reshuffles various portfolios among the<br>
ministers.</li>
<li>He can ask a minister to resign or advise the President to<br>
dismiss him in case of difference of opinion.</li>
<li>He presides over the meeting of council of ministers and<br>
influences its decisions.</li>
<li>He guides, directs, controls, and coordinates the activities of<br>
all the ministers.</li>
<li>He can bring about the collapse of the council of ministers<br>
by resigning from office.<br>
Since the Prime Minister stands at the head of the council of<br>
ministers, the other ministers cannot function when the Prime<br>
Minister resigns or dies. In other words, the resignation or death of<br>
an incumbent Prime Minister automatically dissolves the council of<br>
ministers and thereby generates a vacuum. The resignation or<br>
death of any other minister, on the other hand, merely creates a<br>
vacancy which the Prime Minister may or may not like to fill.<br>
In Relation to the President<br>
The Prime Minister enjoys the following powers in relation to the<br>
President:</li>
<li>He is the principal channel of communication between the<br>
President and the council of ministers.4 It is the duty of the<br>
prime minister:<br>
(a) to communicate to the President all decisions of the<br>
council of ministers relating to the administration of the<br>
affairs of the Union and proposals for legislation;<br>
(b) to furnish such information relating to the administration<br>
of the affairs of the Union and proposals for legislation as<br>
the President may call for; and<br>
(c) if the President so requires, to submit for the<br>
consideration of the council of ministers any matter on<br>
which a decision has been taken by a minister but which<br>
has not been considered by the council.</li>
<li>He advises the president with regard to the appointment of<br>
important officials like attorney general of India, Comptroller<br>
and Auditor General of India, chairman and members of the</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="upsc-election-commissioners-chairman-and-members-of">UPSC, election commissioners, chairman and members of </h1>
<p>the finance commission and so on.<br>
In Relation to Parliament<br>
The Prime Minister is the leader of the Lower House. In this<br>
capacity, he enjoys the following powers:</p>
<ol>
<li>He advises the President with regard to summoning and<br>
proroguing of the sessions of the Parliament.</li>
<li>He can recommend dissolution of the Lok Sabha to<br>
President at any time.</li>
<li>He announces government policies on the floor of the<br>
House.<br>
Other Powers &amp; Functions<br>
In addition to the above-mentioned three major roles, the Prime<br>
Minister has various other roles. These are:</li>
<li>He is the chairman of the # NITI Ayog (which succeded the</li>
</ol>
<p>planning commission), National Integration Council,<br>
InterState Council, National Water Resources Council and<br>
some other bodies.<br>
2. He plays a significant role in shaping the foreign policy of the<br>
country.<br>
3. He is the chief spokesman of the Union government.<br>
4. He is the crisis manager-in-chief at the political level during<br>
emergencies.<br>
5. As a leader of the nation, he meets various sections of<br>
people in different states and receives memoranda from<br>
them regarding their problems, and so on.<br>
6. He is leader of the party in power.<br>
7. He is political head of the services.<br>
Thus, the Prime Minister plays a very significant and highly<br>
crucial role in the politico-administrative system of the country. Dr.<br>
B.R. Ambedkar stated, ‘If any functionary under our constitution is<br>
to be compared with the US president, he is the Prime Minister<br>
and not the president of the Union’.</p>
<h1 id="role--descriptions">ROLE  DESCRIPTIONS </h1>
<p>The various comments made by the eminent political scientists<br>
and constitutional experts on the role of Prime Minister in Britain<br>
holds good in the Indian context also. These are mentioned<br>
below:<br>
Lord Morely<br>
He described Prime Minister as ‘primus inter pares’ (first among<br>
equals) and ‘key stone of the cabinet arch’. He said, “The head of<br>
the cabinet is ‘primus inter pares’, and occupied a position which<br>
so long as it lasts, is one of exceptional and peculiar authority”.<br>
Herbert Marrison<br>
“As the head of the Government, he (prime minister) is ‘primus<br>
inter pares’. But, it is today for too modest an appreciation of the<br>
Prime Minister’s position”.<br>
Sir William Vernor Harcourt<br>
He described Prime Minister as ‘inter stellas luna minores’ (a<br>
moon among lesser stars).<br>
Jennings<br>
“He is, rather, a sun around which planets revolve. He is the keystone<br>
of the constitution. All roads in the constitution lead to the<br>
Prime Minister.”<br>
H.J. Laski<br>
On the relationship between the Prime Minister and the cabinet,<br>
he said that the Prime Minister “is central to its formation, central<br>
to its life, and central to its death”. He described him as “the pivot<br>
around which the entire governmental machinery revolves.”<br>
H.R.G. Greaves<br>
“The Government is the master of the country and he (Prime<br>
Minister) is the master of the Government.”<br>
Munro<br>
He called Prime Minister as “the captain of the ship of the state”.<br>
Ramsay Muir<br>
He described Prime Minister as “the steersman of steering wheel<br>
of the ship of the state.”<br>
The role of the Prime Minister in the British parliamentary<br>
government is so significant and crucial that observers like to call<br>
it a ‘Prime Ministerial government.’ Thus, R.H. Crossman says,<br>
‘The post-war epoch has been the final transformation of cabinet<br>
government into Prime Ministerial government.’ Similarly,<br>
Humphrey Berkely points out, ‘Parliament is not, in practice,<br>
sovereign. The parliamentary democracy has now collapsed at<br>
Westminster. The basic defect in the British system of governing is<br>
the super-ministerial powers of the Prime Minister.’ The same<br>
description holds good to the Indian context too.</p>
<h1 id="relationship--with-the--president">RELATIONSHIP  WITH THE  PRESIDENT </h1>
<p>The following provisions of the Constitution deal with the<br>
relationship between the President and the Prime Minister:</p>
<ol>
<li>Article 74<br>
There shall be a council of ministers with the Prime Minister at the<br>
head to aid and advise the President who shall, in the exercise of<br>
his functions, act in accordance with such advice. However, the<br>
President may require the council of ministers to reconsider such<br>
advice and the President shall act in accordance with the advice<br>
tendered after such reconsideration.</li>
<li>Article 75<br>
(a) The Prime Minister shall be appointed by the President and<br>
the other ministers shall be appointed by the president on the<br>
advice of the Prime Minister; (b) The ministers shall hold office<br>
during the pleasure of the president; and (c) The council of<br>
ministers shall be collectively responsible to the House of the<br>
People.</li>
<li>Article 78<br>
It shall be the duty of the Prime Minister:<br>
(a) to communicate to the President all decisions of the council<br>
of ministers relating to the administration of the affairs of the<br>
Union and proposals for legislation;<br>
(b) to furnish such information relating to the administration of<br>
the affairs of the Union and proposals for legislation as the<br>

(c) if the President so requires, to submit for the consideration of<br>
the council of ministers any matter on which a decision has<br>
been taken by a minister but which has not been considered<br>
by the council.</li>

<p>Six people–Morarji Desai, Charan Singh, V.P. Singh, P.V.<br>
Narasimha Rao, H.D. Deve Gowda and Narendra Modi–became<br>
Prime Ministers after being Chief Ministers of their respective<br>
States. Morarji Desai, Chief Minister of the erstwhile Bombay<br>
State during 1952–56, became the first non-Congress Prime<br>
Minister in March 1977. Charan Singh, who succeeded him, was<br>
the Chief Minister of the undivided Uttar Pradesh in 1967–1968<br>
and again in 1970. V.P. Singh, also from U.P., became Prime<br>
Minister in the short lived National Front government (December<br>
1989-November 1990). P.V. Narasimha Rao, the first Prime<br>
Minister from South India, who held the post from 1991–1996,<br>
was Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh between 1971–1973. H.D.<br>
Deve Gowda was Chief Minister of Karnataka when he was<br>
chosen to lead the United Front government in June 19965 .<br>
Narendra Modi (BJP) was the Chief Minister of Gujarat when<br>
he became the Prime Minister in May 2014. He served as the<br>

with the status of the council of ministers while Article 75 deals<br>
with the appointment, tenure, responsibility, qualification, oath and<br>
salaries and allowances of the ministers.</li>

</ol>
<h1 id="nature-of--advice-by--ministers">NATURE OF  ADVICE BY  MINISTERS </h1>
<p>Article 74 provides for a council of ministers with the Prime<br>
Minister at the head to aid and advise the President in the<br>
exercise of his functions. The 42nd and 44th Constitutional<br>
Amendment Acts have made the advice binding on the<br>
President.1 Further, the nature of advice tendered by ministers to<br>
the President cannot be enquired by any court. This provision<br>
emphasises the intimate and the confidential relationship between<br>
the President and the ministers.<br>
In 1971, the Supreme Court held that ‘even after the dissolution<br>
of the Lok Sabha, the council of ministers does not cease to hold<br>
office. Article 74 is mandatory and, therefore, the president cannot<br>
exercise the executive power without the aid and advise of the<br>
council of ministers. Any exercise of executive power without the<br>
aid and advice will be unconstitutional as being violative of Article<br>
74’. Again in 1974, the court held that ‘wherever the Constitution<br>
requires the satisfaction of the President, the satisfaction is not<br>
the personal satisfaction of the President but it is the satisfaction<br>
of the council of ministers with whose aid and on whose advice<br>
the President exercises his powers and functions’.</p>
<h1 id="appointment-of--ministers">APPOINTMENT OF  MINISTERS </h1>
<p>The Prime Minister is appointed by the President, while the other<br>
ministers are appointed by the President on the advice of the<br>
Prime Minister. This means that the President can appoint only<br>
those persons as ministers who are recommended by the Prime<br>
minister.<br>
Usually, the members of Parliament, either Lok Sabha or Rajya<br>
Sabha, are appointed as ministers. A person who is not a member<br>
of either House of Parliament can also be appointed as a minister.<br>
But, within six months, he must become a member (either by<br>
election or by nomination) of either House of Parliament,<br>
otherwise, he ceases to be a minister.<br>
A minister who is a member of one House of Parliament has<br>
the right to speak and to take part in the proceedings of the other<br>
House also, but he can vote only in the House of which he is a<br>
member.</p>
<h1 id="oath-and--salary-of--ministers">OATH AND  SALARY OF  MINISTERS </h1>
<p>Before a minister enters upon his office, the president administers<br>
to him the oaths of office and secrecy. In his oath of office, the<br>
minister swears:</p>
<ol>
<li>to bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India,</li>
<li>to uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India,</li>
<li>to faithfully and conscientiously discharge the duties of his<br>
office, and</li>
<li>to do right to all manner of people in accordance with the<br>
Constitution and the law, without fear or favour, affection or<br>
ill will.<br>
In his oath of secrecy, the minister swears that he will not<br>
directly or indirectly communicate or reveal to any person(s) any<br>
matter that is brought under his consideration or becomes known<br>
to him as a Union minister except as may be required for the due<br>
discharge of his duties as such minister.<br>
In 1990, the oath by Devi Lal as deputy prime minister was<br>
challenged as being unconstitutional as the Constitution provides<br>
only for the Prime Minister and ministers. The Supreme Court<br>
upheld the oath as valid and stated that describing a person as<br>
Deputy Prime Minister is descriptive only and such description<br>
does not confer on him any powers of Prime Minister. It ruled that<br>
the description of a minister as Deputy Prime Minister or any other<br>
type of minister such as minister of state or deputy minister of<br>
which there is no mention in the Constitution does not vitiate the<br>
oath taken by him so long as the substantive part of the oath is<br>
correct.<br>
The salaries and allowances of ministers are determined by<br>
Parliament from time to time.2 A minister gets the salary and<br>
allowances that are payable to a member of Parliament.<br>
Additionally, he gets a sumptuary allowance (according to his<br>
rank), free accommodation, travelling allowance, medical facilities,<br>
etc. In 2001, the sumptuary allowance for the prime minister was<br>
raised from ₹1,500 to ₹3,000 per month, for a cabinet minister<br>
from ₹1,000 to ₹2,000 per month, for a minister of state from ₹500<br>
to ₹1,000 per month and for a deputy minister from ₹300 to ₹600<br>
per month.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="responsibility-of--ministers">RESPONSIBILITY OF  MINISTERS </h1>
<p>Collective Responsibility<br>
The fundamental principle underlying the working of parliamentary<br>
system of government is the principle of collective responsibility.<br>
Article 75 clearly states that the council of ministers is collectively<br>
responsible to the Lok Sabha. This means that all the ministers<br>
own joint responsibility to the Lok Sabha for all their acts of<br>
ommission and commission. They work as a team and swim or<br>
sink together. When the Lok Sabha passes a no-confidence<br>
motion against the council of ministers, all the ministers have to<br>
resign including those ministers who are from the Rajya Sabha.3<br>
Alternatively, the council of ministers can advise the president to<br>
dissolve the Lok Sabha on the ground that the House does not<br>
represent the views of the electorate faithfully and call for fresh<br>
elections. The President may not oblige the council of ministers<br>
that has lost the confidence of the Lok Sabha.<br>
The principle of collective responsibility also means that the<br>
Cabinet decisions bind all cabinet ministers (and other ministers)<br>
even if they differed in the cabinet meeting. It is the duty of every<br>
minister to stand by cabinet decisions and support them both<br>
within and outside the Parliament. If any minister disagrees with a<br>
cabinet decision and is not prepared to defend it, he must resign.<br>
Several ministers have resigned in the past owing to their<br>
differences with the cabinet. For example, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar<br>
resigned because of his differences with his colleagues on the<br>
Hindu Code Bill in 1953. C.D. Deshmukh resigned due to his<br>
differences on the policy of reorganisation of states. Arif<br>
Mohammed resigned due to his opposition to the Muslim Women<br>
(Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986.<br>
Individual Responsibility<br>
Article 75 also contains the principle of individual responsibility. It<br>
states that the ministers hold office during the pleasure of the<br>
president, which means that the President can remove a minister<br>
even at a time when the council of ministers enjoys the confidence<br>
of the Lok Sabha. However, the President removes a minister only<br>
on the advice of the Prime Minister. In case of a difference of<br>
opinion or dissatisfaction with the performance of a minister, the<br>
Prime Minister can ask him to resign or advice the President to<br>
dismiss him. By exercising this power, the Prime Minister can<br>
ensure the realisation of the rule of collective responsibility. In this<br>
context, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar observed:<br>
“Collective responsibility can be achieved only through the<br>
instrumentality of the Prime Minister. Therefore, unless and<br>
until we create that office and endow that office with statutory<br>
authority to nominate and dismiss ministers, there can be no<br>
collective responsibility.”4<br>
No Legal Responsibility<br>
In Britain, every order of the King for any public act is<br>
countersigned by a minister. If the order is in violation of any law,<br>
the minister would be held responsible and would be liable in the<br>
court. The legally accepted phrase in Britain is, “The king can do<br>
no wrong.” Hence, he cannot be sued in any court.<br>
In India, on the other hand, there is no provision in the<br>
Constitution for the system of legal responsibility of a minister. It is<br>
not required that an order of the President for a public act should<br>
be countersigned by a minister. Moreover, the courts are barred<br>
from enquiring into the nature of advice rendered by the ministers<br>
to the president.</p>
<h1 id="composition-of-the--council-of--ministers">COMPOSITION OF THE  COUNCIL OF  MINISTERS </h1>
<p>The council of ministers consists of three categories of ministers,<br>
namely, cabinet ministers, ministers of state,5 and deputy<br>
ministers. The difference between them lies in their respective<br>
ranks, emoluments, and political importance. At the top of all<br>
these ministers stands the Prime Minister–the supreme governing<br>
authority of the country.<br>
The cabinet ministers head the important ministries of the<br>
Central government like home, defence, finance, external affairs<br>
and so forth. They are members of the cabinet, attend its<br>
meetings and play an important role in deciding policies. Thus,<br>
their responsibilities extend over the entire gamut of Central<br>
government.<br>
The ministers of state can either be given independent charge<br>
of ministries/ departments or can be attached to cabinet ministers.<br>
In case of attachment, they may either be given the charge of<br>
departments of the ministries headed by the cabinet ministers or<br>
allotted specific items of work related to the ministries headed by<br>
cabinet ministers. In both the cases, they work under the<br>
supervision and guidance as well as under the overall charge and<br>
responsibility of the cabinet ministers. In case of independent<br>
charge, they perform the same functions and exercise the same<br>
powers in relation to their ministries/departments as cabinet<br>
ministers do. However, they are not members of the cabinet and<br>
do not attend the cabinet meetings unless specially invited when<br>
something related to their ministries/ departments are considered<br>
by the cabinet.<br>
Next in rank are the deputy ministers. They are not given<br>
independent charge of ministries/departments. They are attached<br>
to the cabinet ministers or ministers of state and assist them in<br>
their administrative, political, and parliamentary duties. They are<br>
not members of the cabinet and do not attend cabinet meetings.<br>
It must also be mentioned here that there is one more category<br>
of ministers, called parliamentary secretaries. They are the<br>
members of the last category of the council of ministers (which is<br>
also known as the ‘ministry’). They have no department under<br>
their control. They are attached to the senior ministers and assist<br>
them in the discharge of their parliamentary duties. However,<br>
since 1967, no parliamentary secretaries have been appointed<br>
except during the first phase of Rajiv Gandhi Government.<br>
At times, the council of ministers may also include a deputy<br>
prime minister. The deputy prime ministers are appointed mostly<br>
for political reasons.</p>
<h1 id="council-of--ministers-vs--cabinet">COUNCIL OF  MINISTERS VS  CABINET </h1>
<p>The words ‘council of ministers’ and ‘cabinet’ are often used<br>
interchangeably though there is a definite distinction between<br>
them. They differ from each other in respects of composition,<br>
functions, and role. These differences are shown in Table 20.1.</p>
<h1 id="role-of--cabinet">ROLE OF  CABINET </h1>

<li>It is the highest decision-making authority in our politicoadministrative<br>

<li>It is the supreme executive authority of the Central<br>
government.</li>
<li>It is chief coordinator of Central administration.</li>
<li>It is an advisory body to the president and its advice is<br>

</ol>
<h1 id="role--descriptions-1">ROLE  DESCRIPTIONS </h1>
<p>The various comments made by the eminent political scientists<br>
and constitutional experts on the role of cabinet in Britain holds<br>
good in the Indian context also. These are mentioned below.<br>
Ramsay Muir<br>
“The Cabinet is the steering wheel of the ship of the state.”<br>
Lowell<br>
“The Cabinet is the keystone of the political arch”.<br>
Sir John Marriott<br>
“The Cabinet is the pivot around which the whole political<br>
machinery revolves”.<br>
Gladstone<br>
“The Cabinet is the solar orb around which the other bodies<br>
revolve”.<br>
Barker<br>
“The Cabinet is the magnet of policy”.<br>
Bagehot<br>
“The Cabinet is a hyphen that joins, the buckle that binds the<br>
executive and legislative departments together”.<br>
Sir Ivor Jennings<br>
“The Cabinet is the core of the British Constitutional System. It<br>
provides unity to the British system of Government”.<br>
L.S. Amery<br>
“The Cabinet is the central directing instrument of Government”.<br>
The position of the Cabinet in the British Government has<br>
become so strong that Ramsay Muir referred to it as the<br>
‘Dictatorship of the Cabinet’. In his book ‘How Britain is<br>
Governed’, he writes “A body which wields such powers as these<br>
may fairly be described as ‘omnipotent’ in theory, however,<br>
incapable it may be of using its omnipotence. Its position,<br>
whenever it commands a majority, is a dictatorship only qualified<br>
by publicity. This dictatorship is far more absolute that it was two<br>
generations ago”. The same description holds good in the Indian<br>
context too.</p>
<h1 id="kitchen--cabinet">KITCHEN  CABINET </h1>
<p>The cabinet, a small body consisting of the prime minister as its<br>
head and some 15 to 20 most important ministers, is the highest<br>
decision-making body in the formal sense. However, a still smaller<br>
body called the ‘Inner Cabinet’ or ‘Kitchen Cabinet’ has become<br>
the real centre of power. This informal body consists of the Prime<br>
Minister and two to four influential colleagues in whom he has<br>
faith and with whom he can discuss every problem. It advises the<br>
prime minister on important political and administrative issues and<br>
assists him in making crucial decisions. It is composed of not only<br>
cabinet ministers but also outsiders like friends and family<br>
members of the prime minister.<br>
Every prime minister in India has had his ‘Inner Cabinet’–a<br>
circle within a circle. During the era of Indira Gandhi, the ‘Inner<br>
Cabinet’ which came to be called the ‘Kitchen Cabinet’ was<br>
particularly powerful.<br>
The prime ministers have resorted to the device of ‘inner<br>
cabinet’ (extra-constitutional body) due to its merits, namely:</p>
<ol>
<li>It being a small unit, is much more efficient decision-making<br>
body than a large cabinet.</li>
<li>It can meet more often and deal with business much more<br>
expeditiously than the large cabinet.</li>
<li>It helps the Prime Minister in maintaining secrecy in making<br>
decisions on important political issues.<br>
However, it has many demerits also. Thus,6</li>
<li>It reduces the authority and status of the cabinet as the<br>
highest decision-making body.</li>
<li>It circumvents the legal process by allowing outside persons<br>
to play an influential role in the government functioning.<br>
The phenomenon of ‘kitchen cabinet’ (where decisions are<br>
cooked and placed before the cabinet for formal approval) is not<br>
unique to India. It also exists in USA and Britain and is quite<br>
powerful in influencing government decisions there.</li>

21 Cabinet Committees</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="features-of--cabinet--committees">FEATURES OF  CABINET  COMMITTEES </h1>
<p>The following are the features of Cabinet Committees:</p>
<ol>
<li>They are extra-constitutional in emergence. In other words,<br>
they are not mentioned in the Constitution. However, the<br>
Rules of Business provide for their establishment.</li>
<li>They are of two types–standing and ad hoc. The former are<br>
of a permanent nature while the latter are of a temporary<br>
nature. The ad hoc committees are constituted from time to<br>
time to deal with special problems. They are disbanded after<br>
their task is completed.1</li>
<li>They are set up by the Prime Minister according to the<br>
exigencies of the time and requirements of the situation.<br>
Hence, their number, nomenclature, and composition varies<br>
from time to time.</li>
<li>Their membership varies from three to eight. They usually<br>
include only Cabinet Ministers. However, the non-cabinet<br>
Ministers are not debarred from their membership.</li>
<li>They not only include the Ministers in charge of subjects<br>
covered by them but also include other senior Ministers.</li>
<li>They are mostly headed by the Prime Minister. Some times<br>
other Cabinet Ministers, particularly the Home Minister or the<br>
Finance Minister, also acts as their Chairman. But, in case<br>
the Prime Minister is a member of a committee, he invariably<br>
presides over it.</li>
<li>They not only sort out issues and formulate proposals for the<br>
consideration of the Cabinet, but also take decisions.<br>
However, the Cabinet can review their decisions.</li>
<li>They are an organisational device to reduce the enormous<br>
workload of the Cabinet. They also facilitate in-depth<br>
examination of policy issues and effective coordination. They<br>
are based on the principles of division of labour and effective<br>
delegation.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="list-of--cabinet--committees">LIST OF  CABINET  COMMITTEES </h1>

<h1 id="functions-of--cabinet--committees">FUNCTIONS OF  CABINET  COMMITTEES </h1>
<p>The following four are the more important cabinet committees:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Political Affairs Committee deals with all policy matters<br>
pertaining to domestic and foreign affairs.</li>
<li>The Economic Affairs Committee directs and coordinates<br>
the governmental activities in the economic sphere.</li>
<li>Appointments Committee decides all higher level<br>
appointments in the Central Secretariat, Public Enterprises,<br>
Banks and Financial Institutions.</li>
<li>Parliamentary Affairs Committee looks after the progress of<br>
government business in the Parliament.<br>
The first three committees are chaired by the Prime Minister<br>
and the last one by the Home Minister. Of all the Cabinet<br>
Committees, the most powerful is the Political Affairs Committee,<br>
often described as a “Super-Cabinet”.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="groups-of--ministers">GROUPS OF  MINISTERS </h1>
<p>In addition to cabinet committees, several Groups of Ministers<br>
(GoMs) are constituted to look into different issues / subjects.<br>
Some of these GoMs are empowered to take decisions on behalf<br>
of the Cabinet whereas the others make recommendations to the<br>
Cabinet.2<br>
The institution of GoMs has become a viable and effective<br>
instrument of coordination among the ministries. These are ad hoc<br>
bodies formed to give recommendations to the cabinet on certain<br>
emergent issues and critical problem areas. Ministers heading the<br>
concerned ministries are inducted into the relevant GoMs and<br>
when the advice is crystallised they are disbanded.3<br>
The Second Administrative Reforms Commission (2005–2009)<br>
made the following observations and recommendations with<br>
respect to the working of the GoMs4 :</p>
<ol>
<li>The Commission observed that the constitution of a large<br>
number of GoMs has resulted in many GoMs not being able<br>
to meet regularly to complete their work thus leading to<br>
significant delays on many major issues.</li>
<li>The Commission felt that more selective use of the<br>
institution of GoMs would perhaps lead to more effective<br>
coordination particularly if they are empowered to arrive at a<br>
decision on behalf of the Cabinet with time limits that are<br>
prescribed for completing the work entrusted to them.</li>
<li>The Commission recommended that there is need to ensure<br>
that the existing coordination mechanism of GoMs function<br>
effectively and helps in early resolution of issues. Selective,<br>
but effective use of GoMs with clear mandate and prescribed<br>
time limits would be helpful.</li>

22 Parliament<br>
he Parliament is the legislative organ of the Union<br>
government. It occupies a pre-eminent and central position<br>
in the Indian democratic political system due to adoption of<br>
the parliamentary form of government, also known as<br>
‘Westminster’ model of government1 .<br>
Articles 79 to 122 in Part V of the Constitution deal with the<br>
organisation, composition, duration, officers, procedures,<br>
privileges, powers and so on of the Parliament.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="organisation-of--parliament">ORGANISATION OF  PARLIAMENT </h1>
<p>Under the Constitution, the Parliament of India consists of three<br>
parts viz, the President, the Council of States and the House of<br>
the People. In 1954, the Hindi names ‘Rajya Sabha’ and ‘Lok<br>
Sabha’ were adopted by the Council of States and the House of<br>
People respectively. The Rajya Sabha is the Upper House<br>
(Second Chamber or House of Elders) and the Lok Sabha is the<br>
Lower House (First Chamber or Popular House). The former<br>
represents the states and union territories of the Indian Union,<br>
while the latter represents the people of India as a whole.<br>
Though the President of India is not a member of either House<br>
of Parliament and does not sit in the Parliament to attend its<br>
meetings, he is an integral part of the Parliament. This is because<br>
a bill passed by both the Houses of Parliament cannot become<br>
law without the President’s assent. He also performs certain<br>
functions relating to the proceedings of the Parliament, for<br>
example, he summons and pro-rogues both the Houses, dissolves<br>
the Lok Sabha, addresses both the Houses, issues ordinances<br>
when they are not in session, and so on.<br>
In this respect, the framers of the Indian Constitution relied on<br>
the British pattern rather than the American pattern. In Britain, the<br>
Parliament consists of the Crown (King or Queen), the House of<br>
Lords (Upper House) and the House of Commons (Lower House).<br>
By contrast, the American president is not an integral part of the<br>
legislature. In USA, the legislature, which is known as Congress,<br>
consists of the Senate (Upper House) and the House of<br>
Representatives (Lower House).<br>
The parliamentary form of government emphasises on the<br>
interdependence between the legislative and executive organs.<br>
Hence, we have the ‘President-in-Parliament’ like the ‘Crown-in-<br>
Parliament’ in Britain. The presidential form of government, on the<br>
other hand, lays stress on the separation of legislative and<br>
executive organs. Hence, the American president is not regarded<br>
as a constituent part of the Congress.</p>
<h1 id="composition-of-the-two--houses">COMPOSITION OF THE TWO  HOUSES </h1>
<p>Composition of Rajya Sabha<br>
The maximum strength of the Rajya Sabha is fixed at 250, out of<br>
which, 238 are to be the representatives of the states and union<br>
territories (elected indirectly) and 12 are nominated by the<br>
president.<br>
At present, the Rajya Sabha has 245 members. Of these, 229<br>
members represent the states, 4 members represent the union<br>
territories and 12 members are nominated by the president.<br>
The Fourth Schedule of the Constitution deals with the<br>
allocation of seats in the Rajya Sabha to the states and union<br>
territories2 .</p>
<ol>
<li>Representation of States<br>
The representatives of states in the Rajya Sabha are elected by<br>
the elected members of state legislative assemblies. The election<br>
is held in accordance with the system of proportional<br>
representation by means of the single transferable vote. The seats<br>
are allotted to the states in the Rajya Sabha on the basis of<br>
population. Hence, the number of representatives varies from<br>
state to state. For example, Uttar Pradesh has 31 members while<br>
Tripura has 1 member only. However, in USA, all states are given<br>
equal representation in the Senate irrespective of their population.<br>
USA has 50 states and the Senate has 100 members–2 from<br>
each state.</li>
<li>Representation of Union Territories<br>
The representatives of each union territory in the Rajya Sabha are<br>
indirectly elected by members of an electoral college specially<br>
constituted for the purpose. This election is also held in<br>
accordance with the system of proportional representation by<br>
means of the single transferable vote. Out of the nine union<br>
territories, only three (Delhi, Puducherry and Jammu &amp; Kashmir)<br>
have representation in Rajya Sabha. The populations of other six<br>
union territories are too small to have any representative in the<br>
Rajya Sabha.</li>
<li>Nominated Members<br>
The president nominates 12 members to the Rajya Sabha from<br>
people who have special knowledge or practical experience in art,<br>
literature, science and social service. The rationale behind this<br>
principle of nomination is to provide eminent persons a place in<br>
the Rajya Sabha without going through the process of election. It<br>
should be noted here that the American Senate has no nominated<br>
members.<br>
Composition of Lok Sabha<br>
The maximum strength of the Lok Sabha is fixed at 552. Out of<br>
this, 530 members are to be the representatives of the states, 20<br>
members are to be the representatives of the union territories and<br>
2 members are to be nominated by the president from the Anglo-<br>
Indian community3 .<br>
At present, the Lok Sabha has 545 members. Of these, 530<br>
members represent the states, 13 members represent the union<br>
territories and 2 Anglo-Indian members are nominated by the<br>
President4 .</li>
<li>Representation of States<br>
The representatives of states in the Lok Sabha are directly elected<br>
by the people from the territorial constituencies in the states. The<br>
election is based on the principle of universal adult franchise.<br>
Every Indian citizen who is above 18 years of age and who is not<br>
disqualified under the provisions of the Constitution or any law is<br>
eligible to vote at such election. The voting age was reduced from<br>
21 to 18 years by the 61st Constitutional Amendment Act, 1988.</li>
<li>Representation of Union Territories<br>
The Constitution has empowered the Parliament to prescribe the<br>
manner of choosing the representatives of the union territories in<br>
the Lok Sabha. Accordingly, the Parliament has enacted the<br>
Union Territories (Direct Election to the House of the People) Act,<br>
1965, by which the members of Lok Sabha from the union<br>
territories are also chosen by direct election.</li>
<li>Nominated Members<br>
The president can nominate two members from the Anglo-Indian<br>
community if the community is not adequately represented in the<br>
Lok Sabha. Originally, this provision was to operate till 1960 but<br>
has been extended till 2020 by the 95th Amendment Act, 2009.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="system-of--elections-to-lok--sabha">SYSTEM OF  ELECTIONS TO LOK  SABHA </h1>
<p>The various aspects related to the system of elections to the Lok<br>
Sabha are as follows:<br>
Territorial Constituencies<br>
For the purpose of holding direct elections to the Lok Sabha, each<br>
state is divided into territorial constituencies. In this respect, the<br>
Constitution makes the following two provisions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Each state is allotted a number of seats in the Lok Sabha in<br>
such a manner that the ratio between that number and its<br>
population is the same for all states. This provision does not<br>
apply to a state having a population of less than six millions.</li>
<li>Each state is divided into territorial constituencies in such a<br>
manner that the ratio between the population of each<br>
constituency and the number of seats allotted to it is the<br>
same throughout the state.<br>
In brief, the Constitution ensures that there is uniformity of<br>
representation in two respects: (a) between the different states,<br>
and b) between the different constituencies in the same state.<br>
The expression ‘population’ means the population as<br>
ascertained at the preceding census of which the relevant figures<br>
have been published.<br>
Readjustment after each Census<br>
After every census, a readjustment is to be made in (a) allocation<br>
of seats in the Lok Sabha to the states, and (b) division of each<br>
state into territorial constituencies. Parliament is empowered to<br>
determine the authority and the manner in which it is to be made.<br>
Accordingly, the Parliament has enacted the Delimitation<br>
Commission Acts in 1952, 1962, 1972 and 2002 for this purpose.<br>
The 42nd Amendment Act of 1976 froze the allocation of seats<br>
in the Lok Sabha to the states and the division of each state into<br>
territorial constituencies till the year 2000 at the 1971 level. This<br>
ban on readjustment was extended for another 25 years (ie, upto<br>
year 2026) by the 84th Amendment Act of 2001, with the same<br>
objective of encouraging population limiting measures.<br>
The 84th Amendment Act of 2001 also empowered the<br>
government to undertake readjustment and rationalisation of<br>
territorial constituencies in the states on the basis of the<br>
population figures of 1991 census. Later, the 87th Amendment Act<br>
of 2003 provided for the delimitation of constituencies on the basis<br>
of 2001 census and not 1991 census. However, this can be done<br>
without altering the number of seats allotted to each state in the<br>
Lok Sabha.<br>
Reservation of Seats for SCs and STs<br>
Though the Constitution has abandoned the system of communal<br>
representation, it provides for the reservation of seats for<br>
scheduled castes and scheduled tribes in the Lok Sabha on the<br>
basis of population ratios5 .<br>
Originally, this reservation was to operate for ten years (ie, up<br>
to 1960), but it has been extended continuously since then by 10<br>
years each time. Now, under the 95th Amendment Act of 2009,<br>
this reservation is to last until 2020.<br>
Though seats are reserved for scheduled castes and scheduled<br>
tribes, they are elected by all the voters in a constituency, without<br>
any separate electorate. A member of scheduled castes and<br>
scheduled tribes is also not debarred from contesting a general<br>
(non-reserved) seat.<br>
The 84th Amendment Act of 2001 provided for refixing of the<br>
reserved seats on the basis of the population figures of 1991<br>
census as applied to rationalisation of the general seats. Later, the<br>
87th Amendment Act of 2003 provided for the refixing of the<br>
reserved seats on the basis of 2001 census and not 1991 census.<br>
First-Past-The-Post System<br>
Though the Constitution has adopted the system of proportional<br>
representation in the case of Rajya Sabha, it has not preferred the<br>
same system in the case of Lok Sabha. Instead, it has adopted<br>
the system of territorial representation (First-past-the-post system)<br>
for the election of members to the Lok Sabha.<br>
Under territorial representation, every member of the legislature<br>
represents a geographical area known as a constituency. From<br>
each constituency, only one representative is elected. Hence such<br>
a constituency is known as single-member constituency. In this<br>
system, a candidate who secures majority of votes is declared<br>
elected. This simple majority system of representation does not<br>
represent the whole electorate. In other words, it does not secure<br>
due representation to minorities (small groups).<br>
The system of proportional representation aims at removing the<br>
defects of territorial representation. Under this system, all sections<br>
of the people get representation in proportion to their number.<br>
Even the smallest section of the population gets its due share of<br>
representation in the legislature.<br>
There are two kinds of proportional representation, namely,<br>
single transferable vote system and list system. In India, the first<br>
kind is adopted for the election of members to the Rajya Sabha<br>
and state legislative council and for electing the President and the<br>
Vice-President.<br>
Though some members of the Constituent Assembly had<br>
advocated the system of proportional representation for the<br>
election of members to the Lok Sabha, the Constitution has not<br>
adopted the system due to two reasons.</li>
<li>Difficulty for the voters to understand the system (which is<br>
complicated) due to low literacy scale in the country.</li>
<li>Unsuitability to the parliamentary government due to the<br>
tendency of the system to multiply political parties leading to<br>
instability in government.<br>
Additionally, the system of proportional representation has the<br>
following demerits:</li>
<li>It is highly expensive.</li>
<li>It does not give any scope for organising by-elections.</li>
<li>It eliminates intimate contacts between voters and<br>
representatives.</li>
<li>It promotes minority thinking and group interests.</li>
<li>It increases the significance of party system and decreases<br>
that of voter.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="duration-of-two--houses">DURATION OF TWO  HOUSES </h1>
<p>Duration of Rajya Sabha<br>
The Rajya Sabha (first constituted in 1952) is a continuing<br>
chamber, that is, it is a permanent body and not subject to<br>
dissolution. However, one-third of its members retire every second<br>
year. Their seats are filled up by fresh elections and presidential<br>
nominations at the beginning of every third year. The retiring<br>
members are eligible for re-election and renomination any number<br>
of times.<br>
The Constitution has not fixed the term of office of members of<br>
the Rajya Sabha and left it to the Parliament. Accordingly, the<br>
Parliament in the Representation of the People Act (1951)<br>
provided that the term of office of a member of the Rajya Sabha<br>
shall be six years. The act also empowered the president of India<br>
to curtail the term of members chosen in the first Rajya Sabha. In<br>
the first batch, it was decided by lottery as to who should retire.<br>
Further, the act also authorised the President to make provisions<br>
to govern the order of retirement of the members of the Rajya<br>
Sabha6 .<br>
Duration of Lok Sabha<br>
Unlike the Rajya Sabha, the Lok Sabha is not a continuing<br>
chamber. Its normal term is five years from the date of its first<br>
meeting after the general elections, after which it automatically<br>
dissolves. However, the President is authorised to dissolve the<br>
Lok Sabha at any time even before the completion of five years<br>
and this cannot be challenged in a court of law.<br>
Further, the term of the Lok Sabha can be extended during the<br>
period of national emergency be a law of Parliament for one year<br>
at a time7 for any length of time. However, this extension cannot<br>
continue beyond a period of six months after the emergency has<br>
ceased to operate.</p>
<h1 id="membership-of--parliament">MEMBERSHIP OF  PARLIAMENT </h1>
<p>Qualifications<br>
The Constitution lays down the following qualifications for a<br>
person to be chosen a member of the Parliament:</p>
<ol>
<li>He must be a citizen of India.</li>
<li>He must make and subscribe to an oath or affirmation<br>
before the person authorised by the election commission for<br>
this purpose. In his oath or affirmation, he swears<br>
(a) To bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of<br>
India<br>
(b) To uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India</li>
<li>He must be not less than 30 years of age in the case of the<br>
Rajya Sabha and not less than 25 years of age in the case<br>
of the Lok Sabha.</li>
<li>He must posses other qualifications prescribed by<br>
Parliament.<br>
The Parliament has laid down the following additional<br>
qualifications in the Representation of People Act (1951).</li>
<li>He must be registered as an elector for a parliamentary<br>
constituency. This is same in the case of both, the Rajya<br>
Sabha and the Lok Sabha. The requirement that a candidate<br>
contesting an election to the Rajya Sabha from a particular<br>
state should be an elector in that particular state was<br>
dispensed with in 2003. In 2006, the Supreme Court upheld<br>
the constitutional validity of this change.</li>
<li>He must be a member of a scheduled caste or scheduled<br>
tribe in any state or union territory, if he wants to contest a<br>
seat reserved for them. However, a member of scheduled<br>
castes or scheduled tribes can also contest a seat not<br>
reserved for them.<br>
Disqualifications<br>
Under the Constitution, a person shall be disqualified for being<br>
elected as a member of Parliament:</li>
<li>if he holds any office of profit under the Union or state<br>
government (except that of a minister or any other office<br>
exempted by Parliament).8</li>
<li>if he is of unsound mind and stands so declared by a court.</li>
<li>if he is an undischarged insolvent.</li>
<li>if he is not a citizen of India or has voluntarily acquired the<br>
citizenship of a foreign state or is under any<br>
acknowledgement of allegiance to a foreign state; and</li>
<li>if he is so disqualified under any law made by Parliament.<br>
The Parliament has laid down the following additional<br>
disqualifications in the Representation of People Act (1951):</li>
<li>He must not have been found guilty of certain election<br>
offences or corrupt practices in the elections.</li>
<li>He must not have been convicted for any offence resulting in<br>
imprisonment for two or more years. But, the detention of a<br>
person under a preventive detention law is not a<br>
disqualification.</li>
<li>He must not have failed to lodge an account of his election<br>
expenses within the time.</li>
<li>He must not have any interest in government contracts,<br>
works or services.</li>
<li>He must not be a director or managing agent nor hold an<br>
office of profit in a corporation in which the government has<br>
at least 25 per cent share.</li>
<li>He must not have been dismissed from government service<br>
for corruption or disloyalty to the State.</li>
<li>He must not have been convicted for promoting enmity<br>
between different groups or for the offence of bribery.</li>
<li>He must not have been punished for preaching and<br>
practising social crimes such as untouchability, dowry and<br>
sati.<br>
On the question whether a member is subject to any of the<br>
above disqualifications, the president’s decision is final. However,<br>
he should obtain the opinion of the election commission and act<br>
accordingly.<br>
Disqualification on Ground of Defection<br>
The Constitution also lays down that a person shall be disqualified<br>
from being a member of Parliament if he is so disqualified on the<br>
ground of defection under the provisions of the Tenth Schedule. A<br>
member incurs disqualification under the defection law:</li>
<li>if he voluntary gives up the membership of the political party<br>
on whose ticket he is elected to the House;</li>
<li>if he votes or abstains from voting in the House contrary to<br>
any direction given by his political party;</li>
<li>if any independently elected member joins any political<br>
party; and</li>
<li>if any nominated member joins any political party after the<br>
expiry of six months.<br>
The question of disqualification under the Tenth Schedule is<br>
decided by the Chairman in the case of Rajya Sabha and Speaker<br>
in the case of Lok Sabha (and not by the president of India). In<br>
1992, the Supreme Court ruled that the decision of the Chairman/<br>
Speaker in this regard is subject to judicial review.<br>
Vacating of Seats<br>
In the following cases, a member of Parliament vacates his seat.</li>
<li>Double Membership<br>
A person cannot be a member of both Houses of Parliament at<br>
the same time. Thus, the Representation of People Act (1951)<br>
provides for the following:<br>
(a) If a person is elected to both the Houses of Parliament, he<br>
must intimate within 10 days in which House he desires to<br>
serve. In default of such intimation, his seat in the Rajya<br>
Sabha becomes vacant.<br>
(b) If a sitting member of one House is also elected to the other<br>
House, his seat in the first House becomes vacant.<br>
(c) If a person is elected to two seats in a House, he should<br>
exercise his option for one. Otherwise, both seats become<br>
vacant.<br>
Similarly, a person cannot be a member of both the Parliament<br>
and the state legislature at the same time. If a person is so<br>
elected, his seat in Parliament becomes vacant if he does not<br>
resign his seat in the state legislature within 14 days9 .</li>
<li>Disqualification<br>
If a member of Parliament becomes subject to any of the<br>
disqualifications specified in the Constitution, his seat becomes<br>
vacant. Here, the list of disqualifications also include the<br>
disqualification on the grounds of defection under the provisions of<br>
the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution.</li>
<li>Resignation<br>
A member may resign his seat by writing to the Chairman of Rajya<br>
Sabha or Speaker of Lok Sabha, as the case may be. The seat<br>
falls vacant when the resignation is accepted. However, the<br>
Chairman/ Speaker may not accept the resignation if he is<br>
satisfied that it is not voluntary or genuine.</li>
<li>Absence<br>
A House can declare the seat of a member vacant if he is absent<br>
from all its meetings for a period of sixty days without its<br>
permission. In computing the period of sixty days, no account<br>
shall be taken of any period during which the House is prorogued<br>
or adjourned for more than four consecutive days.</li>
<li>Other cases<br>
A member has to vacate his seat in the Parliament:<br>
(a) if his election is declared void by the court;<br>
(b) if he is expelled by the House;<br>
(c) if he is elected to the office of President or Vice-President;<br>
and<br>
(d) if he is appointed to the office of governor of a state.<br>
If a disqualified person is elected to the Parliament, the<br>
Constitution lays down no procedure to declare the election void.<br>
This matter is dealt by the Representation of the People Act<br>
(1951), which enables the high court to declare an election void if<br>
a disqualified candidate is elected. The aggrieved party can<br>
appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the high court in<br>
this regard.<br>
Oath or Affirmation<br>
Every member of either House of Parliament, before taking his<br>
seat in the House, has to make and subscribe to an oath or<br>
affirmation before the President or some person appointed by him<br>
for this purpose. In his oath or affirmation, a member of Parliament<br>
swears:</li>
<li>to bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India;</li>
<li>to uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India; and</li>
<li>to faithfully discharge the duty upon which he is about to<br>
enter.<br>
Unless a member takes the oath, he cannot vote and<br>
participate in the proceedings of the House and does not become<br>
eligible to parliamentary privileges and immunities.<br>
A person is liable to a penalty of ₹500 for each day he sits or<br>
votes as a member in a House in the following conditions:</li>
<li>Before taking and subscribing to the prescribed oath or<br>
affirmation; or</li>
<li>When he knows that he is not qualified or that he is<br>
disqualified for its membership; or</li>
<li>When he knows that he is prohibited from sitting or voting in<br>
the House by virtue of any parliamentary law.<br>
Salaries and Allowances<br>
Members of either House of Parliament are entitled to receive<br>
such salaries and allowances as may be determined by<br>
Parliament, and there is no provision of pension in the<br>
Constitution. However, Parliament has provided pension to the<br>
members.<br>
In 1954, the Parliament enacted the Salaries, Allowances and<br>
Pension of Members of Parliament Act. In 2018, the salary of<br>
members was increased from ₹50,000 to ₹1,00,000 per month,<br>
the constituency allowance from ₹45,000 to ₹70,000 per month<br>
and the office expenses allowance from ₹45,000 to ₹60,000 per<br>
month. Earlier in 2010, the daily allowance was increased from<br>
₹1,000 to ₹2,000 for each day of residence on duty.<br>
From 1976, the members are also entitled to a pension on a<br>
graduated scale for each five-year-term as members of either<br>
House of Parliament. Besides, they are provided with travelling<br>
facilities, free accommodation, telephone, vehicle advance,<br>
medical facilities and so on.<br>
The salaries and allowances of the Speaker and Deputy<br>
Speaker of Lok Sabha and the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of<br>
Rajya Sabha are also determined by Parliament. They are<br>
charged on the Consolidated Fund of India and thus are not<br>
subject to the annual vote of Parliament.<br>
In 1953, the Parliament enacted the Salaries and Allowances of<br>
Officers of Parliament Act. Under this Act, “Officer of Parliament”<br>
means any of the following officers, namely, the Chairman and<br>
Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha and the Speaker and the<br>
Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha. In 2018, the Parliament<br>
increased the salary of the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha from<br>
₹1.25 lakh to ₹4 lakh per month9a. Similarly, other Officers of<br>
Parliament (i.e., the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker of the Lok<br>
Sabha and the Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha) are entitled<br>
to receive a salary per month at the same rates as are payable to<br>
the Members of Parliament.9b Further, each Officer of Parliament<br>
(other than the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha) is entitled to receive<br>
a daily allowance (for each day during the whole of his term) at<br>
the same rate as is payable to the Members of Parliament.9c Also,<br>
each Officer of Parliament (other than the Chairman of the Rajya<br>
Sabha) is entitled to receive a constituency allowance at the same<br>
rate as is payable to the Members of Parliament.9d<br>
According to the same Act, the sumptuary allowance is paid to<br>
the Speaker of the Lok Sabha at the same rate as is payable to a<br>
Cabinet Minister9e (i.e., ₹2,000 per month). Likewise, the<br>
sumptuary allowance is paid to the Deputy Speaker of the Lok<br>
Sabha and the Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha at the same<br>
rate as is payable to a Minister of State9f (i.e., ₹1000 per month).</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="presiding--officers-of--parliament">PRESIDING  OFFICERS OF  PARLIAMENT </h1>
<p>Each House of Parliament has its own presiding officer. There is a<br>
Speaker and a Deputy Speaker for the Lok Sabha and a<br>
Chairman and a Deputy Chairman for the Rajya Sabha. A panel of<br>
chairpersons for the Lok Sabha and a panel of vice-chairpersons<br>
for the Rajya Sabha is also appointed.<br>
Speaker of Lok Sabha<br>
Election and Tenure<br>
The Speaker is elected by the Lok Sabha from amongst its<br>
members (as soon as may be, after its first sitting). Whenever the<br>
office of the Speaker falls vacant, the Lok Sabha elects another<br>
member to fill the vacancy. The date of election of the Speaker is<br>
fixed by the President.<br>
Usually, the Speaker remains in office during the life of the Lok<br>
Sabha. However, he has to vacate his office earlier in any of the<br>
following three cases:</p>
<ol>
<li>if he ceases to be a member of the Lok Sabha;</li>
<li>if he resigns by writing to the Deputy Speaker; and</li>
<li>if he is removed by a resolution passed by a majority of all<br>
then members of the Lok Sabha. Such a resolution can be<br>
moved only after giving 14 days’ advance notice.<br>
When a resolution for the removal of the Speaker is under<br>
consideration of the House, he cannot preside at the sitting of the<br>
House, though he may be present. However, he can speak and<br>
take part in the proceedings of the House at such a time and vote<br>
in the first instance, though not in the case of an equality of votes.<br>
It should be noted here that, whenever the Lok Sabha is<br>
dissolved, the Speaker does not vacate his office and continues<br>
till the newly-elected Lok Sabha meets.<br>
Role, Powers and Functions<br>
The Speaker is the head of the Lok Sabha, and its representative.<br>
He is the guardian of powers and privileges of the members, the<br>
House as a whole and its committees. He is the principal<br>
spokesman of the House, and his decision in all Parliamentary<br>
matters is final. He is thus much more than merely the presiding<br>
officer of the Lok Sabha. In these capacities, he is vested with<br>
vast, varied and vital responsibilities and enjoys great honour,<br>
high dignity and supreme authority within the House.<br>
The Speaker of the Lok Sabha derives his powers and duties<br>
from three sources, that is, the Constitution of India, the Rules of<br>
Procedure and Conduct of Business of Lok Sabha, and<br>
Parliamentary Conventions (residuary powers that are unwritten<br>
or unspecified in the Rules). Altogether, he has the following<br>
powers and duties:</li>
<li>He maintains order and decorum in the House for<br>
conducting its business and regulating its proceedings. This<br>
is his primary responsibility and he has final power in this<br>
regard.</li>
<li>He is the final interpreter of the provisions of (a) the<br>
Constitution of India, (b) the Rules of Procedure and<br>
Conduct of Business of Lok Sabha, and (c) the<br>
parliamentary precedents, within the House.</li>
<li>He adjourns the House or suspends the meeting in absence<br>
of a quorum. The quorum to constitute a meeting of the<br>
House is one-tenth of the total strength of the House.</li>
<li>He does not vote in the first instance. But he can exercise a<br>
casting vote in the case of a tie. In other words, only when<br>
the House is divided equally on any question, the Speaker is<br>
entitled to vote. Such vote is called casting vote, and its<br>
purpose is to resolve a deadlock.</li>
<li>He presides over a joint setting of the two Houses of<br>
Parliament. Such a sitting is summoned by the President to<br>
settle a deadlock between the two Houses on a bill.</li>
<li>He can allow a ‘secret’ sitting of the House at the request of<br>
the Leader of the House. When the House sits in secret, no<br>
stranger can be present in the chamber, lobby or galleries<br>
except with the permission of the Speaker.</li>
<li>He decides whether a bill is a money bill or not and his<br>
decision on this question is final. When a money bill is<br>
transmitted to the Rajya Sabha for recommendation and<br>
presented to the President for assent, the Speaker endorses<br>
on the bill his certificate that it is a money bill.</li>
<li>He decides the questions of disqualification of a member of<br>
the Lok Sabha, arising on the ground of defection under the<br>
provisions of the Tenth Schedule. In 1992, the Supreme<br>
Court ruled that the decision of the Speaker in this regard is<br>
subject to judicial review10 .</li>
<li>He acts as the ex-officio chairman of the Indian<br>
Parliamentary Group which is a link between the Parliament<br>
of India and the various parliaments of the world. He also<br>
acts as the ex-officio chairman of the conference of<br>
presiding officers of legislative bodies in the country.</li>
<li>He appoints the chairman of all the parliamentary<br>
committees of the Lok Sabha and supervises their<br>
functioning. He himself is the chairman of the Business<br>
Advisory Committee, the Rules Committee and the General<br>
Purpose Committee.<br>
Independence and Impartiality<br>
As the office of the Speaker is vested with great prestige, position<br>
and authority, independence and impartiality becomes its sine qua<br>
non11 .<br>
The following provisions ensure the independence and<br>
impartiality of the office of the Speaker:</li>
<li>He is provided with a security of tenure. He can be removed<br>
only by a resolution passed by the Lok Sabha by a special<br>
majority (ie, a majority of all the then members of the House)<br>
and not by an ordinary majority (ie, a majority of the<br>
members present and voting in the House). This motion of<br>
removal can be considered and discussed only when it has<br>
the support of at least 50 members.</li>
<li>His salaries and allowances are fixed by Parliament. They<br>
are charged on the Consolidated Fund of India and thus are<br>
not subject to the annual vote of Parliament.</li>
<li>His work and conduct cannot be discussed and criticised in<br>
the Lok Sabha except on a substantive motion.</li>
<li>His powers of regulating procedure or conducting business<br>
or maintaining order in the House are not subject to the<br>
jurisdiction of any Court.</li>
<li>He cannot vote in the first instance. He can only exercise a<br>
casting vote in the event of a tie. This makes the position of<br>
Speaker impartial.</li>
<li>He is given a very high position in the order of precedence.<br>
He is placed at seventh rank, along with the Chief Justice of<br>
India. This means, he has a higher rank than all cabinet<br>
ministers, except the Prime Minister or Deputy Prime<br>
Minister.<br>
In Britain, the Speaker is strictly a nonparty man. There is a<br>
convention that the Speaker has to resign from his party and<br>
remain politically neutral. This healthy convention is not fully<br>
established in India where the Speaker does not resign from the<br>
membership of his party on his election to the exalted office.<br>
Deputy Speaker of Lok Sabha<br>
Like the Speaker, the Deputy Speaker is also elected by the Lok<br>
Sabha itself from amongst its members. He is elected after the<br>
election of the Speaker has taken place. The date of election of<br>
the Deputy Speaker is fixed by the Speaker. Whenever the office<br>
of the Deputy Speaker falls vacant, the Lok Sabha elects another<br>
member to fill the vacancy.<br>
Like the Speaker, the Deputy Speaker remains in office usually<br>
during the life of the Lok Sabha. However, he may vacate his<br>
office earlier in any of the following three cases:</li>
<li>if he ceases to be a member of the Lok Sabha;</li>
<li>if he resigns by writing to the Speaker; and</li>
<li>if he is removed by a resolution passed by a majority of all<br>
the then members of the Lok Sabha. Such a resolution can<br>
be moved only after giving 14 days’ advance notice.<br>
The Deputy Speaker performs the duties of the Speaker’s office<br>
when it is vacant. He also acts as the Speaker when the latter is<br>
absent from the sitting of the House. In both the cases, he<br>
assumes all the powers of the Speaker. He also presides over the<br>
joint sitting of both the Houses of Parliament, in case the Speaker<br>
is absent from such a sitting.<br>
It should be noted here that the Deputy Speaker is not<br>
subordinate to the Speaker. He is directly responsible to the<br>
House.<br>
The Deputy Speaker has one special privilege, that is,<br>
whenever he is appointed as a member of a parliamentary<br>
committee, he automatically becomes its chairman.<br>
Like the Speaker, the Deputy Speaker, while presiding over the<br>
House, cannot vote in the first instance; he can only exercise a<br>
casting vote in the case of a tie. Further, when a resolution for the<br>
removal of the Deputy Speaker is under consideration of the<br>
House, he cannot preside at the sitting of the House, though he<br>
may be present.<br>
When the Speaker presides over the House, the Deputy<br>
Speaker is like any other ordinary member of the House. He can<br>
speak in the House, participate in its proceedings and vote on any<br>
question before the House.<br>
The Deputy Speaker is entitled to a regular salary and<br>
allowance fixed by Parliament, and charged on the Consolidated<br>
Fund of India.<br>
Upto the 10th Lok Sabha, both the Speaker and the Deputy<br>
Speaker were usually from the ruling party. Since the 11th Lok<br>
Sabha, there has been a consensus that the Speaker comes from<br>
the ruling party (or ruling alliance) and the post of Deputy Speaker<br>
goes to the main opposition party.<br>
The Speaker and the Deputy Speaker, while assuming their<br>
offices, do not make and subscribe any separate oath or<br>
affirmation.<br>
The institutions of Speaker and Deputy Speaker originated in<br>
India in 1921 under the provisions of the Government of India Act<br>
of 1919 (Montague-Chelmsford Reforms). At that time, the<br>
Speaker and the Deputy Speaker were called the President and<br>
Deputy President respectively and the same nomenclature<br>
continued till 1947. Before 1921, the Governor-General of India<br>
used to preside over the meetings of the Central Legislative<br>
Council. In 1921, the Frederick Whyte and Sachidanand Sinha<br>
were appointed by the Governor-General of India as the first<br>
Speaker and the first Deputy Speaker (respectively) of the central<br>
legislative assembly. In 1925, Vithalbhai J. Patel became the first<br>
Indian and the first elected Speaker of the central legislative<br>
assembly. The Government of India Act of 1935 changed the<br>
nomenclatures of President and Deputy President of the Central<br>
Legislative Assembly to the Speaker and Deputy Speaker<br>
respectively. However, the old nomenclature continued till 1947 as<br>
the federal part of the 1935 Act was not implemented. G.V.<br>
Mavalankar and Ananthasayanam Ayyangar had the distinction of<br>
being the first Speaker and the first Deputy Speaker (respectively)<br>
of the Lok Sabha. G.V. Mavalankar also held the post of Speaker<br>
in the Constituent Assembly (Legislative) as well as the<br>
provisional Parliament. He held the post of Speaker of Lok Sabha<br>
continuously for one decade from 1946 to 1956.<br>
Panel of Chairpersons of Lok Sabha<br>
Under the Rules of Lok Sabha, the Speaker nominates from<br>
amongst the members a panel of not more than ten chairpersons.<br>
Any of them can preside over the House in the absence of the<br>
Speaker or the Deputy Speaker. He has the same powers as the<br>
Speaker when so presiding. He holds office until a new panel of<br>
chairpersons is nominated. When a member of the panel of<br>
chairpersons is also not present, any other person as determined<br>
by House acts as the Speaker.<br>
It must be emphasised here that a member of the panel of<br>
chairpersons cannot preside over the House, when the office of<br>
the Speaker or the Deputy Speaker is vacant. During such time,<br>
the Speaker’s duties are to be performed by such member of the<br>
House as the President may appoint for the purpose. The<br>
elections are held, as soon as possible, to fill the vacant posts.<br>
Speaker Pro Tem<br>
As provided by the Constitution, the Speaker of the last Lok<br>
Sabha vacates his office immediately before the first meeting of<br>
the newly-elected Lok Sabha. Therefore, the President appoints a<br>
member of the Lok Sabha as the Speaker Pro Tem. Usually, the<br>
seniormost member is selected for this. The President himself<br>
administers oath to the Speaker Pro Tem.<br>
The Speaker Pro Tem has all the powers of the Speaker. He<br>
presides over the first sitting of the newly-elected Lok Sabha. His<br>
main duty is to administer oath to the new members. He also<br>
enables the House to elect the new Speaker.<br>
When the new Speaker is elected by the House, the office of<br>
the Speaker Pro Tem ceases to exist. Hence, this office is a<br>
temporary office, existing for a few days12 .<br>
Chairman of Rajya Sabha<br>
The presiding officer of the Rajya Sabha is known as the<br>
Chairman. The vice-president of India is the ex-officio Chairman of<br>
the Rajya Sabha. During any period when the VicePresident acts<br>
as President or discharges the functions of the President, he does<br>
not perform the duties of the office of the Chairman of Rajya<br>
Sabha.<br>
The Chairman of the Rajya Sabha can be removed from his<br>
office only if he is removed from the office of the Vice-President.<br>
As a presiding officer, the powers and functions of the Chairman<br>
in the Rajya Sabha are similar to those of the Speaker in the Lok<br>
Sabha. However, the Speaker has two special powers which are<br>
not enjoyed by the Chairman:</li>
<li>The Speaker decides whether a bill is a money bill or not<br>
and his decision on this question is final.</li>
<li>The Speaker presides over a joint sitting of two Houses of<br>
Parliament.<br>
Unlike the Speaker (who is a member of the House), the<br>
Chairman is not a member of the House. But like the Speaker, the<br>
Chairman also cannot vote in the first instance. He too can cast a<br>
vote in the case of an equality of votes.<br>
The Vice-President cannot preside over a sitting of the Rajya<br>
Sabha as its Chairman when a resolution for his removal is under<br>
consideration. However, he can be present and speak in the<br>
House and can take part in its proceedings, without voting, even<br>
at such a time (while the Speaker can vote in the first instance<br>
when a resolution for his removal is under consideration of the<br>
Lok Sabha).<br>
As in case of the Speaker, the salaries and allowances of the<br>
Chairman are also fixed by the Parliament. They are charged on<br>
the Consolidated Fund of India and thus are not subject to the<br>
annual vote of Parliament.<br>
During any period when the Vice-President acts as President or<br>
discharges the functions of the President, he is not entitled to any<br>
salary or allowance payable to the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha.<br>
But he is paid the salary and allowance of the President during<br>
such a time.<br>
Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha<br>
The Deputy Chairman is elected by the Rajya Sabha itself from<br>
amongst its members. Whenever the office of the Deputy<br>
Chairman falls vacant, the Rajya Sabha elects another member to<br>
fill the vacancy.<br>
The Deputy Chairman vacates his office in any of the following<br>
three cases:</li>
<li>if he ceases to be a member of the Rajya Sabha;</li>
<li>if he resigns by writing to the Chairman; and</li>
<li>if he is removed by a resolution passed by a majority of all<br>
the then members of the Rajya Sabha. Such a resolution<br>
can be moved only after giving 14 days’ advance notice.<br>
The Deputy Chairman performs the duties of the Chairman’s<br>
office when it is vacant or when the Vice-President acts as<br>
President or discharges the functions of the President. He also<br>
acts as the Chairman when the latter is absent from the sitting of<br>
the House. In both the cases, he has all the powers of the<br>
Chairman.<br>
It should be emphasised here that the Deputy Chairman is not<br>
subordinate to the Chairman. He is directly responsible to the<br>
Rajya Sabha.<br>
Like the Chairman, the Deputy Chairman, while presiding over<br>
the House, cannot vote in the first instance; he can only exercise<br>
a casting vote in the case of a tie. Further, when a resolution for<br>
the removal of the Deputy Chairman is under consideration of the<br>
House, he cannot preside over a sitting of the House, though he<br>
may be present.<br>
When the Chairman presides over the House, the Deputy<br>
Chairman is like any other ordinary member of the House. He can<br>
speak in the House, participate in its proceedings and vote on any<br>
question before the House.<br>
Like the Chairman, the Deputy Chairman is also entitled to a<br>
regular salary and allowance. They are fixed by Parliament and<br>
are charged on the Consolidated Fund of India.<br>
Panel of Vice-Chairpersons of Rajya Sabha<br>
Under the Rules of Rajya Sabha, the Chairman nominates from<br>
amongst the members a panel of vice-chairpersons. Any one of<br>
them can preside over the House in the absence of the Chairman<br>
or the Deputy Chairman. He has the same powers as the<br>
Chairman when so presiding. He holds office until a new panel of<br>
vice-chairpersons is nominated.<br>
When a member of the panel of vicechairpersons is also not<br>
present, any other person as determined by the House acts as the<br>
Chairman.<br>
It must be emphasised here that a member of the panel of vicechairpersons<br>
cannot preside over the House, when the office of<br>
the Chairman or the Deputy Chairman is vacant. During such<br>
time, the Chairman’s duties are to be performed by such member<br>
of the House as the president may appoint for the purpose. The<br>
elections are held, as soon as possible, to fill the vacant posts.<br>
Secretariat of Parliament<br>
Each House of Parliament has separate secretarial staff of its<br>
own, though there can be some posts common to both the<br>
Houses. Their recruitment and service conditions are regulated by<br>
Parliament. The secretariat of each House is headed by a<br>
secretary-general. He is a permanent officer and is appointed by<br>
the presiding officer of the House.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="leaders-in--parliament">LEADERS IN  PARLIAMENT </h1>
<p>Leader of the House<br>
Under the Rules of Lok Sabha, the ‘Leader of the House’ means<br>
the prime minister, if he is a member of the Lok Sabha, or a<br>
minister who is a member of the Lok Sabha and is nominated by<br>
the prime minister to function as the Leader of the House. There is<br>
also a ‘Leader of the House’ in the Rajya Sabha. He is a minister<br>
and a member of the Rajya Sabha and is nominated by the prime<br>
minister to function as such. The leader of the house in either<br>
House is an important functionary and exercises direct influence<br>
on the conduct of business. He can also nominate a deputy leader<br>
of the House. The same functionary in USA is known as the<br>
‘majority leader’.<br>
Leader of the Opposition<br>
In each House of Parliament, there is the ‘Leader of the<br>
Opposition’. The leader of the largest Opposition party having not<br>
less than one-tenth seats of the total strength of the House is<br>
recognised as the leader of the Opposition in that House. In a<br>
parliamentary system of government, the leader of the opposition<br>
has a significant role to play. His main functions are to provide a<br>
constructive criticism of the policies of the government and to<br>
provide an alternative government. Therefore, the leader of<br>
Opposition in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha were accorded<br>
statutory recognition in 1977. They are also entitled to the salary,<br>
allowances and other facilities equivalent to that of a cabinet<br>
minister. It was in 1969 that an official leader of the opposition was<br>
recognised for the first time. The same functionary in USA is<br>
known as the ‘minority leader’.<br>
The British political system has an unique institution called the<br>
‘Shadow Cabinet’. It is formed by the Opposition party to balance<br>
the ruling cabinet and to prepare its members for future ministerial<br>
offices. In this shadow cabinet, almost every member in the ruling<br>
cabinet is ‘shadowed’ by a corresponding member in the<br>
opposition cabinet. This shadow cabinet serves as the ‘alternate<br>
cabinet’ if there is change of government. That is why Ivor<br>
Jennings described the leader of Opposition as the ‘alternative<br>
Prime Minister’. He enjoys the status of a minister and is paid by<br>
the government.<br>
Whip<br>
Though the offices of the leader of the House and the leader of<br>
the Opposition are not mentioned in the Constitution of India, they<br>
are mentioned in the Rules of the House and Parliamentary<br>
Statute respectively. The office of ‘whip’, on the other hand, is<br>
mentioned neither in the Constitution of India nor in the Rules of<br>
the House nor in a Parliamentary Statute. It is based on the<br>
conventions of the parliamentary government.<br>
Every political party, whether ruling or Opposition has its own<br>
whip in the Parliament. He is appointed by the political party to<br>
serve as an assistant floor leader. He is charged with the<br>
responsibility of ensuring the attendance of his party members in<br>
large numbers and securing their support in favour of or against a<br>
particular issue. He regulates and monitors their behaviour in the<br>
Parliament. The members are supposed to follow the directives<br>
given by the whip. Otherwise, disciplinary action can be taken.</p>
<h1 id="sessions-of--parliament">SESSIONS OF  PARLIAMENT </h1>
<p>Summoning<br>
The president from time to time summons each House of<br>
Parliament to meet. But, the maximum gap between two sessions<br>
of Parliament cannot be more than six months. In other words, the<br>
Parliament should meet at least twice ayear. There are usually<br>
three sessions in a year, viz,</p>
<ol>
<li>the Budget Session (February to May);</li>
<li>the Monsoon Session (July to September); and</li>
<li>the Winter Session (November to December).<br>
A ‘session’ of Parliament is the period spanning between the<br>
first sitting of a House and its prorogation (or dissolution in the<br>
case of the Lok Sabha). During a session, the House meets<br>
everyday to transact business. The period spanning between the<br>
prorogation of a House and its reassembly in a new session is<br>
called ‘recess’.<br>
Adjournment<br>
A session of Parliament consists of many meetings. Each meeting<br>
of a day consists of two sittings, that is, a morning sitting from 11<br>
am to 1 pm and post-lunch sitting from 2 pm to 6 pm. A sitting of<br>
Parliament can be terminated by adjournment or adjournment sine<br>
die or prorogation or dissolution (in the case of the Lok Sabha).<br>
An adjournment suspends the work in a sitting for a specified<br>
time, which may be hours, days or weeks.<br>
Adjournment Sine Die<br>
Adjournment sine die means terminating a sitting of Parliament for<br>
an indefinite period. In other words, when the House is adjourned<br>
without naming a day for reassembly, it is called adjournment sine<br>
die. The power of adjournment as well as adjournment sine die<br>
lies with the presiding officer of the House. He can also call a<br>
sitting of the House before the date or time to which it has been<br>
adjourned or at any time after the House has been adjourned sine<br>
die.<br>
Prorogation<br>
The presiding officer (Speaker or Chairman) declares the House<br>
adjourned sine die, when the business of a session is completed.<br>
Within the next few days, the President issues a notification for<br>
prorogation of the session. However, the President can also<br>
prorogue the House while in session.<br>
The specific differences between adjournment and prorogation<br>
are summarised in Table 22.1.<br>
Dissolution<br>
Rajya Sabha, being a permanent House, is not subject to<br>
dissolution. Only the Lok Sabha is subject to dissolution. Unlike a<br>
prorogation, a dissolution ends the very life of the existing House,<br>
and a new House is constituted after general elections are held.<br>
The dissolution of the Lok Sabha may take place in either of two<br>
ways:</li>
<li>Automatic dissolution, that is, on the expiry of its tenure of<br>
five years or the terms as extended during a national<br>
emergency; or</li>
<li>Whenever the President decides to dissolve the House,<br>
which he is authorised to do. Once the Lok Sabha is<br>
dissolved before the completion of its normal tenure, the<br>
dissolution is irrevocable.<br>
When the Lok Sabha is dissolved, all business including bills,<br>
motions, resolutions, notices, petitions and so on pending before it<br>
or its committees lapse. They (to be pursued further) must be<br>
reintroduced in the newly-constituted Lok Sabha. However, some<br>
pending bills and all pending assurances that are to be examined<br>
by the Committee on Government Assurances do not lapse on the<br>
dissolution of the Lok Sabha. The position with respect to lapsing<br>
of bills is as follows:</li>
<li>A bill pending in the Lok Sabha lapses (whether originating<br>
in the Lok Sabha or transmitted to it by the Rajya Sabha).</li>
<li>A bill passed by the Lok Sabha but pending in the Rajya<br>
Sabha lapses.</li>
<li>A bill not passed by the two Houses due to disagreement<br>
and if the president has notified the holding of a joint sitting<br>
before the dissolution of Lok Sabha, does not lapse.</li>
<li>A bill pending in the Rajya Sabha but not passed by the Lok<br>
Sabha does not lapse.</li>
<li>A bill passed by both Houses but pending assent of the<br>
president does not lapse.</li>
<li>A bill passed by both Houses but returned by the president<br>
for reconsideration of Houses does not lapse.</li>
</ol>
<p>Quorum<br>
Quorum is the minimum number of members required to be<br>
present in the House before it can transact any business. It is onetenth<br>
of the total number of members in each House including the<br>
presiding officer. It means that there must be at least 55 members<br>
present in the Lok Sabha and 25 members present in the Rajya<br>
Sabha, if any business is to be conducted. If there is no quorum<br>
during a meeting of the House, it is the duty of the presiding<br>
officer either to adjourn the House or to suspend the meeting until<br>
there is a quorum.<br>
Voting in House<br>
All matters at any sitting of either House or joint sitting of both the<br>
Houses are decided by a majority of votes of the members<br>
present and voting, excluding the presiding officer. Only a few<br>
matters, which are specifically mentioned in the Constitution like<br>
impeachment of the President, amendment of the Constitution,<br>
removal of the presiding officers of the Parliament and so on,<br>
require special majority, not ordinary majority.<br>
The presiding officer of a House does not vote in the first<br>
instance, but exercises a casting vote in the case of an equality of<br>
votes. The proceedings of a House are to be valid irrespective of<br>
any unauthorised voting or participation or any vacancy in its<br>
membership.<br>
The following points can be noted with respect to the voting<br>
procedure in the Lok Sabha:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the conclusion of a debate, the Speaker shall put the<br>
question and invite those who are in favour of the motion to<br>
say ‘Aye’ and those against the motion to say ‘No’.</li>
<li>The Speaker shall then say: ‘I think the Ayes (or the Noes,<br>
as the case may be) have it.’ If the opinion of the Speaker as<br>
to the decision of a question is not challenged, he shall say<br>
twice: The Ayes (or the Noes, as the case may be) have it’<br>
and the question before the House shall be determined<br>
accordingly.</li>
<li>(a) If the opinion of the Speaker as to the decision of a<br>
question is challenged, he shall order that the Lobby be<br>
cleared.<br>
(b) After the lapse of three minutes and thirty seconds, he<br>
shall put the question a second time and declare<br>
whether in his opinion the ‘Ayes’ or the ‘Noes’ have it.<br>
(c) If the opinion so declared is again challenged, he shall<br>
direct that the votes be recorded either by operating the<br>
automatic vote recorder or by using ‘Aye’ and ‘No’ Slips<br>
in the House or by the Members going into the Lobbies.</li>
<li>If in the opinion of the Speaker, the Division is unnecessarily<br>
claimed, he may ask the members who are for ‘Aye’ and<br>
those for ‘No’ respectively to rise in their places and, on a<br>
count being taken, he may declare the determination of the<br>
House. In such a case, the names of the voters shall not be<br>
recorded.<br>
Language in Parliament<br>
The Constitution has declared Hindi and English to be the<br>
languages for transacting business in the Parliament. However,<br>
the presiding officer can permit a member to address the House in<br>
his mother-tongue. In both the Houses, arrangements are made<br>
for simultaneous translation. Though English was to be<br>
discontinued as a floor language after the expiration of fifteen<br>
years from the commencement of the Constitution (that is, in<br>
1965), the Official Languages Act (1963) allowed English to be<br>
continued along with Hindi.<br>
Rights of Ministers and Attorney General<br>
In addition to the members of a House, every minister and the<br>
attorney general of India have the right to speak and take part in<br>
the proceedings of either House, any joint sitting of both the<br>
Houses and any committee of Parliament of which he is a<br>
member, without being entitled to vote. There are two reasons<br>
underlying this constitutional provision:</li>
<li>A minister can participate in the proceedings of a House, of<br>
which he is not a member. In other words, a minister<br>
belonging to the Lok Sabha can participate in the<br>
proceedings of the Rajya Sabha and vice-versa.</li>
<li>A minister, who is not a member of either House, can<br>
participate in the proceedings of both the Houses. It should<br>
be noted here that a person can remain a minister for six<br>
months, without being a member of either House of<br>
Parliament.<br>
Lame-duck Session<br>
It refers to the last session of the existing Lok Sabha, after a new<br>
Lok Sabha has been elected. Those members of the existing Lok<br>
Sabha who could not get re-elected to the new Lok Sabha are<br>
called lame-ducks.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="devices-of--parliamentary--proceedings">DEVICES OF  PARLIAMENTARY  PROCEEDINGS </h1>
<p>Question Hour<br>
The first hour of every parliamentary sitting is slotted for this.<br>
During this time, the members ask questions and the ministers<br>
usually give answers. The questions are of three kinds, namely,<br>
starred, unstarred and short notice.<br>
A starred question (distinguished by an asterisk) requires an<br>
oral answer and hence supplementary questions can follow.<br>
An unstarred question, on the other hand, requires a written<br>
answer and hence, supplementary questions cannot follow.<br>
A short notice question is one that is asked by giving a notice<br>
of less than ten days. It is answered orally.<br>
In addition to the ministers, the questions can also be asked to<br>
the private members. Thus, a question may be addressed to a<br>
private member if the subject matter of the question relates to<br>
some Bill, resolution or other matter connected with the business<br>
of the House for which that member is responsible. The procedure<br>
in regard to such question is the same as that followed in the case<br>
of questions addressed to a minister.<br>
The list of starred, unstarred, short notice questions and<br>
questions to private members are printed in green, white, light<br>
pink and yellow colour, respectively, to distinguish them from one<br>
another.<br>
Zero Hour<br>
Unlike the question hour, the zero hour is not mentioned in the<br>
Rules of Procedure. Thus it is an informal device available to the<br>
members of the Parliament to raise matters without any prior<br>
notice. The zero hour starts immediately after the question hour<br>
and lasts until the agenda for the day (ie, regular business of the<br>
House) is taken up. In other words, the time gap between the<br>
question hour and the agenda is known as zero hour. It is an<br>
Indian innovation in the field of parliamentary procedures and has<br>
been in existence since 1962.<br>
Motions<br>
No discussion on a matter of general public importance can take<br>
place except on a motion made with the consent of the presiding<br>
officer. The House expresses its decisions or opinions on various<br>
issues through the adoption or rejection of motions moved by<br>
either ministers or private members.<br>
The motions moved by the members to raise discussions on<br>
various matters fall into three principal categories:14</p>
<ol>
<li>Substantive Motion: It is a self-contained independent<br>
proposal dealing with a very important matter like<br>
impeachment of the President or removal of Chief Election<br>
Commissioner.</li>
<li>Substitute Motion: It is a motion that is moved in substitution<br>
of an original motion and proposes an alternative to it. If<br>
adopted by the House, it supersedes the original motion.</li>
<li>Subsidiary Motion: It is a motion that, by itself, has no<br>
meaning and cannot state the decision of the House without<br>
reference to the original motion or proceedings of the House.<br>
It is divided into three sub-categories:<br>
(a) Ancillary Motion: It is used as the regular way of<br>
proceeding with various kinds of business.<br>
(b) Superseding Motion: It is moved in the course of debate<br>
on another issue and seeks to supersede that issue.<br>
(c) Amendment: It seeks to modify or substitute only a part<br>
of the original motion.<br>
Closure Motion<br>
It is a motion moved by a member to cut short the debate on a<br>
matter before the House. If the motion is approved by the House,<br>
debate is stopped forthwith and the matter is put to vote. There<br>
are four kinds of closure motions15 :<br>
(a) Simple Closure: It is one when a member moves that the<br>
‘matter having been sufficiently discussed be now put to<br>
vote’.<br>
(b) Closure by Compartments: In this case, the clauses of a bill<br>
or a lengthy resolution are grouped into parts before the<br>
commencement of the debate. The debate covers the part as<br>
a whole and the entire part is put to vote.<br>
(c) Kangaroo Closure: Under this type, only important clauses<br>
are taken up for debate and voting and the intervening<br>
clauses are skipped over and taken as passed.<br>
(d) Guillotine Closure: It is one when the undiscussed clauses of<br>
a bill or a resolution are also put to vote along with the<br>
discussed ones due to want of time (as the time allotted for<br>
the discussion is over).<br>
Privilege Motion<br>
It is concerned with the breach of parliamentary privileges by a<br>
minister. It is moved by a member when he feels that a minister<br>
has committed a breach of privilege of the House or one or more<br>
of its members by withholding facts of a case or by giving wrong<br>
or distorted facts. Its purpose is to censure the concerned<br>
minister.<br>
Calling Attention Motion<br>
It is introduced in the Parliament by a member to call the attention<br>
of a minister to a matter of urgent public importance, and to seek<br>
an authoritative statement from him on that matter. Like the zero<br>
hour, it is also an Indian innovation in the parliamentary procedure<br>
and has been in existence since 1954. However, unlike the zero<br>
hour, it is mentioned in the Rules of Procedure.<br>
Adjournment Motion<br>
It is introduced in the Parliament to draw attention of the House to<br>
a definite matter of urgent public importance, and needs the<br>
support of 50 members to be admitted. As it interrupts the normal<br>
business of the House, it is regarded as an extraordinary device. It<br>
involves an element of censure against the government and<br>
hence Rajya Sabha is not permitted to make use of this device.<br>
The discussion on an adjournment motion should last for not less<br>
than two hours and thirty minutes.<br>
The right to move a motion for an adjournment of the business<br>
of the House is subject to the following restrictions:</li>
<li>It should raise a matter which is definite, factual, urgent and<br>
of public importance;</li>
<li>It should not cover more than one matter;</li>
<li>It should be restricted to a specific matter of recent<br>
occurrence and should not be framed in general terms;</li>
<li>It should not raise a question of privilege;</li>
<li>It should not revive discussion on a matter that has been<br>
discussed in the same session;</li>
<li>It should not deal with any matter that is under adjudication<br>
by court; and</li>
<li>It should not raise any question that can be raised on a<br>
distinct motion.<br>
No-Confidence Motion<br>
Article 75 of the Constitution says that the council of ministers<br>
shall be collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha. It means that<br>
the ministry stays in office so long as it enjoys confidence of the<br>
majority of the members of the Lok Sabha. In other words, the Lok<br>
Sabha can remove the ministry from office by passing a noconfidence<br>
motion. The motion needs the support of 50 members<br>
to be admitted.<br>
Confidence Motion<br>
The motion of confidence has come up as a new procedural<br>
device to cope with the emerging situations of fractured mandates<br>
resulting in hung parliament, minority governments and coalition<br>
governments. The governments formed with wafer-thin majority<br>
have been called upon by the President to prove their majority on<br>
the floor of the House. The government of the day, sometimes, on<br>
its own, seeks to prove its majority by moving a motion of<br>
confidence and winning the confidence of the House. If the<br>
confidence motion is negatived, it results in the fall of the<br>
government15a.<br>
Censure Motion<br>
A censure motion is different from a no-confidence motion as<br>
shown in Table 22.2.<br>
Motion of Thanks<br>
The first session after each general election and the first session<br>
of every fiscal year is addressed by the president. In this address,<br>
the president outlines the policies and programmes of the<br>
government in the preceding year and ensuing year. This address<br>
of the president, which corresponds to the ‘speech from the<br>
Throne in Britain’, is discussed in both the Houses of Parliament<br>
on a motion called the ‘Motion of Thanks’. At the end of the<br>
discussion, the motion is put to vote. This motion must be passed<br>
in the House. Otherwise, it amounts to the defeat of the<br>
government. This inaugural speech of the president is an<br>
occasion available to the members of Parliament to raise<br>
discussions and debates to examine and criticise the government<br>
and administration for its lapses and failures.<br>
No-Day-Yet-Named Motion<br>
It is a motion that has been admitted by the Speaker but no date<br>
has been fixed for its discussion. The Speaker, after considering<br>
the state of business in the House and in consultation with the<br>
leader of the House or on the recommendation of the Business<br>
Advisory Committee, allots a day or days or part of a day for the<br>
discussion of such a motion.<br>
Dilatory Motion<br>
It is a motion for the adjournment of the debate on a bill / motion /<br>
resolution etc. or a motion to retard or delay the progress of a<br>
business under consideration of the House. It can be moved by a<br>
member at any time after a motion has been made. The debate<br>
on a dilatory motion must be restricted to the matter contained in<br>
such motion. If the Speaker is of the opinion that such a motion is<br>
an abuse of the rules of the House, he may either forthwith put the<br>
question thereon or decline to propose the question.<br>
Point of Order<br>
A member can raise a point of order when the proceedings of the<br>
House do not follow the normal rules of procedure. A point of<br>
order should relate to the interpretation or enforcement of the<br>
Rules of the House or such articles of the Constitution that<br>
regulate the business of the House and should raise a question<br>
that is within the cognizance of the Speaker. It is usually raised by<br>
an opposition member in order to control the government. It is an<br>
extraordinary device as it suspends the proceedings before the<br>
House. No debate is allowed on a point of order.</li>
</ol>
<p>Half-an-Hour Discussion<br>
It is meant for discussing a matter of sufficient public importance,<br>
which has been subjected to a lot of debate and the answer to<br>
which needs elucidation on a matter of fact. The Speaker can allot<br>
three days in a week for such discussions. There is no formal<br>
motion or voting before the House.<br>
Short Duration Discussion<br>
It is also known as two-hour discussion as the time allotted for<br>
such a discussion should not exceed two hours. The members of<br>
the Parliament can raise such discussions on a matter of urgent<br>
public importance. The Speaker can allot two days in a week for<br>
such discussions. There is neither a formal motion before the<br>
house nor voting. This device has been in existence since 1953.<br>
Special Mention<br>
A matter which is not a point of order or which cannot be raised<br>
during question hour, half-an hour discussion, short duration<br>
discussion or under adjournment motion, calling attention notice<br>
or under any rule of the House can be raised under the special<br>
mention in the Rajya Sabha. Its equivalent procedural device in<br>
the Lok Sabha is known as ‘Notice (Mention) Under Rule 377’.<br>
Resolutions<br>
The members can move resolutions to draw the attention of the<br>
House or the government to matters of general public interest.<br>
The discussion on a resolution is strictly relevant to and within the<br>
scope of the resolution. A member who has moved a resolution or<br>
amendment to a resolution cannot withdraw the same except by<br>
leave of the House.<br>
Resolutions are classified into three categories:16</p>
<ol>
<li>Private Member’s Resolution: It is one that is moved by a<br>
private member (other than a minister). It is discussed only<br>
on alternate Fridays and in the afternoon sitting.</li>
<li>Government Resolution: It is one that is moved by a<br>
minister. It can be taken up any day from Monday to<br>
Thursday.</li>
<li>Statutory Resolution: It can be moved either by a private<br>
member or a minister. It is so called because it is always<br>
tabled in pursuance of a provision in the Constitution or an<br>
Act of Parliament.<br>
Resolutions are different from motions in the following respects:<br>
“All resolutions come in the category of substantive motions,<br>
that is to say, every resolution is a particular type of motion. All<br>
motions need not necessarily be substantive. Further, all<br>
motions are not necessarily put to vote of the House, whereas<br>
all the resolutions are required to be voted upon.”17<br>
Youth Parliament<br>
The scheme of Youth Parliament was started on the<br>
recommendation of the Fourth All India Whips Conference. Its<br>
objectives are:</li>
<li>to acquaint the younger generations with practices and<br>
procedures of Parliament;</li>
<li>to imbibe the spirit of discipline and tolerance cultivating<br>
character in the minds of youth; and</li>
<li>to inculcate in the student community the basic values of<br>
democracy and to enable them to acquire a proper<br>
perspective on the functioning of democratic institutions.<br>
The ministry of parliamentary affairs provides necessary<br>
training and encouragement to the states in introducing the<br>
scheme.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="legislative--procedure-in--parliament">LEGISLATIVE  PROCEDURE IN  PARLIAMENT </h1>
<p>The legislative procedure is identical in both the Houses of<br>
Parliament. Every bill has to pass through the same stages in<br>
each House. A bill is a proposal for legislation and it becomes an<br>
act or law when duly enacted.<br>
Bills introduced in the Parliament are of two kinds: public bills<br>
and private bills (also known as government bills and private<br>
members’ bills respectively). Though both are governed by the<br>
same general procedure and pass through the same stages in the<br>
House, they differ in various respects as shown in Table 22.3.<br>
The bills introduced in the Parliament can also be classified into<br>
four categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Ordinary bills, which are concerned with any matter other<br>
than financial subjects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Money bills, which are concerned with the financial matters<br>
like taxation, public expenditure, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Financial bills, which are also concerned with financial<br>
matters (but are different from money bills).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Constitution amendment bills, which are concerned with the<br>
amendment of the provisions of the Constitution.<br>
The Constitution has laid down separate procedures for the<br>
enactment of all the four types of bills. The procedures with regard<br>
to ordinary bills, money bills and financial bills are explained here.<br>
The procedure with regard to Constitution amendment bills is<br>
explained in detail in Chapter 10.<br>
Ordinary Bills<br>
Every ordinary bill has to pass through the following five stages in<br>
the Parliament before it finds a place on the Statute Book:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First Reading<br>
An ordinary bill can be introduced in either House of Parliament.<br>
Such a bill can be introduced either by a minister or by any other<br>
member. The member who wants to introduce the bill has to ask<br>
for the leave of the House. When the House grants leave to<br>
introduce the bill, the mover of the bill introduces it by reading its<br>
title and objectives. No discussion on the bill takes place at this<br>
stage. Later, the bill is published in the Gazette of India. If a bill is<br>
published in the Gazette before its introduction, leave of the<br>
House to introduce the bill is not necessary.18 The introduction of<br>
the bill and its publication in the Gazette constitute the first<br>
reading of the bill.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second Reading<br>
During this stage, the bill receives not only the general but also<br>
the detailed scrutiny and assumes its final shape. Hence, it forms<br>
the most important stage in the enactment of a bill. In fact, this<br>
stage involves three more sub-stages, namely, stage of general<br>
discussion, committee stage and consideration stage.<br>
(a) Stage of General Discussion<br>
The printed copies of the bill are distributed to all the members.<br>
The principles of the bill and its provisions are discussed<br>
generally, but the details of the bill are not discussed.<br>
At this stage, the House can take any one of the following four<br>
actions:<br>
(i) It may take the bill into consideration immediately or on<br>
some other fixed date;<br>
(ii) It may refer the bill to a select committee of the House;<br>
(iii) It may refer the bill to a joint committee of the two Houses;<br>
and<br>
(iv) It may circulate the bill to elicit public opinion.<br>
A Select Committee consists of members of the House where<br>
the bill has originated and a joint committee consists of members<br>
of both the Houses of Parliament.<br>
(b) Committee Stage<br>
The usual practice is to refer the bill to a select committee of the<br>
House. This committee examines the bill thoroughly and in detail,<br>
clause by clause. It can also amend its provisions, but without<br>
altering the principles underlying it. After completing the scrutiny<br>
and discussion, the committee reports the bill back to the House.<br>
(c) Consideration Stage<br>
The House, after receiving the bill from the select committee,<br>
considers the provisions of the bill clause by clause. Each clause<br>
is discussed and voted upon separately. The members can also<br>
move amendments and if accepted, they become part of the bill.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Third Reading<br>
At this stage, the debate is confined to the acceptance or rejection<br>
of the bill as a whole and no amendments are allowed, as the<br>
general principles underlying the bill have already been<br>
scrutinised during the stage of second reading. If the majority of<br>
members present and voting accept the bill, the bill is regarded as<br>
passed by the House. Thereafter, the bill is authenticated by the<br>
presiding officer of the House and transmitted to the second<br>
House for consideration and approval. A bill is deemed to have<br>
been passed by the Parliament only when both the Houses have<br>
agreed to it, either with or without amendments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bill in the Second House<br>
In the second House also, the bill passes through all the three<br>
stages, that is, first reading, second reading and third reading.<br>
There are four alternatives before this House:<br>
(a) it may pass the bill as sent by the first house (ie, without<br>
amendments);<br>
(b) it may pass the bill with amendments and return it to the first<br>
House for reconsideration;<br>
(c) it may reject the bill altogether; and<br>
(d) it may not take any action and thus keep the bill pending.<br>
If the second House passes the bill without any amendments or<br>
the first House accepts the amendments suggested by the second<br>
House, the bill is deemed to have been passed by both the<br>
Houses and the same is sent to the president for his assent. On<br>
the other hand, if the first House rejects the amendments<br>
suggested by the second House or the second House rejects the<br>
bill altogether or the second House does not take any action for<br>
six months, a deadlock is deemed to have taken place. To resolve<br>
such a deadlock, the president can summon a joint sitting of the<br>
two Houses. If the majority of members present and voting in the<br>
joint sitting approves the bill, the bill is deemed to have been<br>
passed by both the Houses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assent of the President<br>
Every bill after being passed by both Houses of Parliament either<br>
singly or at a joint sitting, is presented to the president for his<br>
assent. There are three alternatives before the president:<br>
(a) he may give his assent to the bill; or<br>
(b) he may withhold his assent to the bill; or<br>
(c) he may return the bill for reconsideration of the Houses.<br>
If the president gives his assent to the bill, the bill becomes an<br>
act and is placed on the Statute Book. If the President withholds<br>
his assent to the bill, it ends and does not become an act. If the<br>
President returns the bill for reconsideration and if it is passed by<br>
both the Houses again with or without amendments and<br>
presented to the President for his assent, the president must give<br>
his assent to the bill. Thus, the President enjoys only a<br>
“suspensive veto.”19<br>
Money Bills<br>
Article 110 of the Constitution deals with the definition of money<br>
bills. It states that a bill is deemed to be a money bill if it contains<br>
‘only’ provisions dealing with all or any of the following matters:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The imposition, abolition, remission, alteration or regulation<br>
of any tax;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The regulation of the borrowing of money by the Union<br>
government;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The custody of the Consolidated Fund of India or the<br>
contingency fund of India, the payment of moneys into or the<br>
withdrawal of money from any such fund;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The appropriation of money out of the Consolidated Fund of<br>
India;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Declaration of any expenditure charged on the Consolidated<br>
Fund of India or increasing the amount of any such<br>
expenditure;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The receipt of money on account of the Consolidated Fund<br>
of India or the public account of India or the custody or issue<br>
of such money, or the audit of the accounts of the Union or<br>
of a state; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any matter incidental to any of the matters specified above.<br>
However, a bill is not to be deemed to be a money bill by<br>
reason only that it provides for:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the imposition of fines or other pecuniary penalties, or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the demand or payment of fees for licenses or fees for<br>
services rendered; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the imposition, abolition, remission, alteration or regulation<br>
of any tax by any local authority or body for local purposes.<br>
If any question arises whether a bill is a money bill or not, the<br>
decision of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha is final. His decision in<br>
this regard cannot be questioned in any court of law or in the<br>
either House of Parliament or even the president. When a money<br>
bill is transmitted to the Rajya Sabha for recommendation and<br>
presented to the president for assent, the Speaker endorses it as<br>
a money bill.<br>
The Constitution lays down a special procedure for the passing<br>
of money bills in the Parliament. A money bill can only be<br>
introduced in the Lok Sabha and that too on the recommendation<br>
of the president. Every such bill is considered to be a government<br>
bill and can be introduced only by a minister.<br>
After a money bill is passed by the Lok Sabha, it is transmitted<br>
to the Rajya Sabha for its consideration. The Rajya Sabha has<br>
restricted powers with regard to a money bill. It cannot reject or<br>
amend a money bill. It can only make the recommendations. It<br>
must return the bill to the Lok Sabha within 14 days, whether with<br>
or without recommendations. The Lok Sabha can either accept or<br>
reject all or any of the recommendations of the Rajya Sabha.<br>
If the Lok Sabha accepts any recommendation, the bill is then<br>
deemed to have been passed by both the Houses in the modified<br>
form. If the Lok Sabha does not accept any recommendation, the<br>
bill is then deemed to have passed by both the Houses in the form<br>
originally passed by the Lok Sabha without any change.<br>
If the Rajya Sabha does not return the bill to the Lok Sabha<br>
within 14 days, the bill is deemed to have been passed by both<br>
the Houses in the form originally passed by the Lok Sabha. Thus,<br>
the Lok Sabha has more powers than Rajya Sabha with regard to<br>
a money bill. On the other hand, both the Houses have equal<br>
powers with regard to an ordinary bill.<br>
Finally, when a money bill is presented to the president, he may<br>
either give his assent to the bill or withhold his assent to the bill<br>
but cannot return the bill for reconsideration of the Houses.<br>
Normally, the president gives his assent to a money bill as it is<br>
introduced in the Parliament with his prior permission.<br>
Table 22.4 shows the differences between the procedures for<br>
the enactment of ordinary bills and money bills.<br>
Financial Bills<br>
Financial bills are those bills that deal with fiscal matters, that is,<br>
revenue or expenditure. However, the Constitution uses the term<br>
‘financial bill’ in a technical sense. Financial bills are of three<br>
kinds:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Money bills–Article 110</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Financial bills (I)–Article 117 (1)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Financial bills (II)–Article 117 (3)<br>
This classification implies that money bills are simply a species<br>
of financial bills. Hence, all money bills are financial bills but all<br>
financial bills are not money bills. Only those financial bills are<br>
money bills which contain exclusively those matters which are<br>
mentioned in Article 110 of the Constitution. These are also<br>
certified by the Speaker of Lok Sabha as money bills. The<br>
financial bills (I) and (II), on the other hand, have been dealt with<br>
in Article 117 of the Constitution.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Financial Bills (I)<br>
A financial bill (I) is a bill that contains not only any or all the<br>
matters mentioned in Article 110, but also other matters of general<br>
legislation. For instance, a bill that contains a borrowing clause,<br>
but does not exclusively deal with borrowing. In two respects, a<br>
financial bill (I) is similar to a money bill–(a) both of them can be<br>
introduced only in the Lok Sabha and not in the Rajya Sabha, and<br>
(b) both of them can be introduced only on the recommendation of<br>
the president. In all other respects, a financial bill (I) is governed<br>
by the same legislative procedure applicable to an ordinary bill.<br>
Hence, it can be either rejected or amended by the Rajya Sabha<br>
(except that an amendment other than for reduction or abolition of<br>
a tax cannot be moved in either House without the<br>
recommendation of the president i.e., the recommendation of<br>
president is not required for moving an amendment making<br>
provision for the reduction or aboli-sition of a tax). In case of a<br>
disagreement between the two Houses over such a bill, the<br>
president can summon a joint sitting of the two Houses to resolve<br>
the deadlock. When the bill is presented to the President, he can<br>
either give his assent to the bill or withhold his assent to the bill or<br>
return the bill for reconsideration of the Houses.<br>
Financial Bills (II)<br>
A financial bill (II) contains provisions involving expenditure from<br>
the Consolidated Fund of India, but does not include any of the<br>
matters mentioned in Article 110. It is treated as an ordinary bill<br>
and in all respects, it is governed by the same legislative<br>
procedure which is applicable to an ordinary bill. The only special<br>
feature of this bill is that it cannot be passed by either House of<br>
Parliament unless the President has recommended to that House<br>
the consideration of the bill. Hence, financial bill (II) can be<br>
introduced in either House of Parliament and recommendation of<br>
the President is not necessary for its introduction. In other words,<br>
the recommendation of the President is not required at the<br>
introduction stage but is required at the consideration stage. It can<br>
be either rejected or amended by either House of Parliament. In<br>
case of a disagreement between the two Houses over such a bill,<br>
the President can summon a joint sitting of the two Houses to<br>
resolve the deadlock. When the bill is presented to the President,<br>
he can either give his assent to the bill or withhold his assent to<br>
the bill or return the bill for reconsideration of the Houses.</p>
<h1 id="joint--sitting-of-two--houses">JOINT  SITTING OF TWO  HOUSES </h1>
<p>Joint sitting is an extraordinary machinery provided by the<br>
Constitution to resolve a deadlock between the two Houses over<br>
the passage of a bill. A deadlock is deemed to have taken place<br>
under any one of the following three situations after a bill has<br>
been passed by one House and transmitted to the other House:</p>
<ol>
<li>if the bill is rejected by the other House;</li>
<li>if the Houses have finally disagreed as to the amendments<br>
to be made in the bill; or</li>
<li>if more than six months have elapsed from the date of the<br>
receipt of the bill by the other House without the bill being<br>
passed by it.<br>
In the above three situations, the president can summon both<br>
the Houses to meet in a joint sitting for the purpose of deliberating<br>
and voting on the bill. It must be noted here that the provision of<br>
joint sitting is applicable to ordinary bills or financial bills only and<br>
not to money bills or Constitutional amendment bills. In the case<br>
of a money bill, the Lok Sabha has overriding powers, while a<br>
Constitutional amendment bill must be passed by each House<br>
separately.<br>
In reckoning the period of six months, no account can be taken<br>
of any period during which the other House (to which the bill has<br>
been sent) is prorogued or adjourned for more than four<br>
consecutive days.<br>
If the bill (under dispute) has already lapsed due to the<br>
dissolution of the Lok Sabha, no joint sitting can be summoned.<br>
But, the joint sitting can be held if the Lok Sabha is dissolved after<br>
the President has notified his intention to summon such a sitting<br>
(as the bill does not lapse in this case). After the President notifies<br>
his intention to summon a joint sitting of the two Houses, none of<br>
the Houses can proceed further with the bill.<br>
The Speaker of Lok Sabha presides over a joint sitting of the<br>
two Houses and the Deputy Speaker, in his absence. If the<br>
Deputy Speaker is also absent from a joint sitting, the Deputy<br>
Chairman of Rajya Sabha presides. If he is also absent, such<br>
other person as may be determined by the members present at<br>
the joint sitting, presides over the meeting. It is clear that the<br>
Chairman of Rajya Sabha does not preside over a joint sitting as<br>
he is not a member of either House of Parliament.<br>
The quorum to constitute a joint sitting is one-tenth of the total<br>
number of members of the two Houses. The joint sitting is<br>
governed by the Rules of Procedure of Lok Sabha and not of<br>
Rajya Sabha.<br>
If the bill in dispute is passed by a majority of the total number<br>
of members of both the Houses present and voting in the joint<br>
sitting, the bill is deemed to have been passed by both the<br>
Houses. Normally, the Lok Sabha with greater number wins the<br>
battle in a joint sitting.<br>
The Constitution has specified that at a joint sitting, new<br>
amendments to the bill cannot be proposed except in two cases:</li>
<li>those amendments that have caused final disagreement<br>
between the Houses; and</li>
<li>those amendments that might have become necessary due<br>
to the delay in the passage of the bill.<br>
Since 1950, the provision regarding the joint sitting of the two<br>
Houses has been invoked only thrice. The bills that have been<br>
passed at joint sittings are:</li>
<li>Dowry Prohibition Bill, 1960.20</li>
<li>Banking Service Commission (Repeal)<br>
Bill, 1977.21</li>
<li>Prevention of Terrorism Bill, 2002.22</li>

<h1 id="budget-in--parliament">BUDGET IN  PARLIAMENT </h1>
<p>The Constitution refers to the budget as the ‘annual financial<br>
statement’. In other words, the term ‘budget’ has nowhere been<br>
used in the Constitution. It is the popular name for the ‘annual<br>
financial statement’ that has been dealt with in Article 112 of the<br>
Constitution.<br>
The budget is a statement of the estimated receipts and<br>
expenditure of the Government of India in a financial year, which<br>
begins on 1 April and ends on 31 March of the following year.<br>
In addition to the estimates of receipts and expenditure, the<br>
budget contains certain other elements. Overall, the budget<br>
contains the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Estimates of revenue and capital receipts;</li>
<li>Ways and means to raise the revenue;</li>
<li>Estimates of expenditure;</li>
<li>Details of the actual receipts and expenditure of the closing<br>
financial year and the reasons for any deficit or surplus in<br>
that year; and</li>
<li>Economic and financial policy of the coming year, that is,<br>
taxation proposals, prospects of revenue, spending<br>
programme and introduction of new schemes/projects.<br>
Till 2017, the Government of India had two budgets, namely,<br>
the Railway Budget and the General Budget. While the former<br>
consisted of the estimates of receipts and expenditures of only the<br>
Ministry of Railways, the latter consisted of the estimates of<br>
receipts and expenditure of all the ministries of the Government of<br>
India (except the railways).<br>
The Railway Budget was separated from the General Budget in<br>
1924 on the recommendations of the Acworth Committee Report<br>
(1921). The reasons or objectives of this separation were as<br>
follows:</li>
<li>To introduce flexibility in railway finance.</li>
<li>To facilitate a business approach to the railway policy.</li>
<li>To secure stability of the general revenues by providing an<br>
assured annual contribution from railway revenues.</li>
<li>To enable the railways to keep their profits for their own<br>
development (after paying a fixed annual contribution to the<br>
general revenues).<br>
In 2017, the Central Government merged the railway budget<br>
into the general budget. Hence, there is now only one budget for<br>
the Government of India i.e., Union Budget.<br>
Constitutional Provisions<br>
The Constitution of India contains the following provisions with<br>
regard to the enactment of budget:</li>
<li>The President shall in respect of every financial year cause<br>
to be laid before both the Houses of Parliament a statement<br>
of estimated receipts and expenditure of the Government of<br>
India for that year.</li>
<li>No demand for a grant shall be made except on the<br>
recommendation of the President.</li>
<li>No money shall be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of<br>
India except under appropriation made by law.</li>
<li>No money bill imposing tax shall be introduced in the<br>
Parliament except on the recommendation of the President,<br>
and such a bill shall not be introduced in the Rajya Sabha.</li>
<li>No tax shall be levied or collected except by authority of law.</li>
<li>Parliament can reduce or abolish a tax but cannot increase<br>
it.</li>
<li>The Constitution has also defined the relative roles or<br>
position of both the Houses of Parliament with regard to the<br>
enactment of the budget in the following way:<br>
(a) A money bill or finance bill dealing with taxation cannot<br>
be introduced in the Rajya Sabha–it must be introduced<br>
only in the Lok Sabha.<br>
(b) The Rajya Sabha has no power to vote on the demand<br>
for grants; it is the exclusive privilege of the Lok Sabha.<br>
(c) The Rajya Sabha should return the Money bill (or<br>
Finance bill) to the Lok Sabha within fourteen days. The<br>
Lok Sabha can either accept or reject the<br>
recommendations made by Rajya Sabha in this regard.</li>
<li>The estimates of expenditure embodied in the budget shall<br>
show separately the expenditure charged on the<br>
Consolidated Fund of India and the expenditure made from<br>
the Consolidated Fund of India.</li>
<li>The budget shall distinguish expenditure on revenue<br>
account from other expenditure.</li>
<li>The expenditure charged on the Consolidated Fund of India<br>
shall not be submitted to the vote of Parliament. However, it<br>
can be discussed by the Parliament.<br>
Charged Expenditure<br>
The budget consists of two types of expen-diture–the expenditure<br>
‘charged’ upon the Consolidated Fund of India and the<br>
expenditure ‘made’ from the Consolidated Fund of India. The<br>
charged expenditure is non-votable by the Parliament, that is, it<br>
can only be discussed by the Parliament, while the other type has<br>
to be voted by the Parliament. The list of the charged expenditure<br>
is as follows:</li>
<li>Emoluments and allowances of the President and other<br>
expenditure relating to his office.</li>
<li>Salaries and allowances of the Chairman and the Deputy<br>
Chairman of the Rajya Sabha and the Speaker and the<br>
Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha.</li>
<li>Salaries, allowances and pensions of the judges of the<br>
Supreme Court.</li>
<li>Pensions of the judges of high courts.</li>
<li>Salary, allowances and pension of the Comptroller and<br>
Auditor General of India.</li>
<li>Salaries, allowances and pension of the chairman and<br>
members of the Union Public Service Commission.</li>
<li>Administrative expenses of the Supreme Court, the office of<br>
the Comptroller and Auditor General of India and the Union<br>
Public Service Commission including the salaries,<br>
allowances and pensions of the persons serving in these<br>
offices.</li>
<li>The debt charges for which the Government of India is<br>
liable, including interest, sinking fund charges and<br>
redemption charges and other expenditure relating to the<br>
raising of loans and the service and redemption of debt.</li>
<li>Any sum required to satisfy any judgement, decree or award<br>
of any court or arbitral tribunal.</li>
<li>Any other expenditure declared by the Parliament to be so<br>
charged.<br>
Stages in Enactment<br>
The budget goes through the following six stages in the<br>
Parliament:</li>
<li>Presentation of budget.</li>
<li>General discussion.</li>
<li>Scrutiny by departmental committees.</li>
<li>Voting on demands for grants.</li>
<li>Passing of appropriation bill.</li>
<li>Passing of finance bill.</li>
<li>Presentation of Budget<br>
Conventionally, the budget is presented to the Lok Sabha by the<br>
finance minister on the last working day of February. Since 2017,<br>
the presentation of the budget has been advanced to 1st of<br>
February.<br>
The Budget can also be presented to the House in two or more<br>
parts and when such presentation takes place, each part shall be<br>
dealt with as if it were the budget. Further, there shall be no<br>
discussion of the budget on the day on which it is presented to the<br>
House.<br>
The finance minister presents the budget with a speech known<br>
as the ‘budget speech’. At the end of the speech in the Lok<br>
Sabha, the budget is laid before the Rajya Sabha, which can only<br>
discuss it and has no power to vote on the demands for grants.<br>
The budget documents presented to the Parliament comprise<br>
of the following :<br>
(i) Budget Speech<br>
(ii) Annual Financial Statement<br>
(iii) Demands for Grants<br>
(iv) Appropriation Bill<br>
(v) Finance Bill<br>
(vi) Statements mandated under the # FRBM Act:</li>
</ol>
<p>(a) Macro-Economic Framework Statement<br>
(b) Fiscal Policy Strategy Statement<br>
(c) Medium Term Fiscal Policy Statement<br>
(vii) Expenditure Budget<br>
(viii) Receipts Budget<br>
(ix) Expenditure Profile<br>
(x) Memorandum Explaining the Provisions in the Finance Bill<br>
(xi) Budget at a Glance<br>
(xii) Outcome Budget<br>
Earlier, the Economic Survey also used to be presented to the<br>
Parliament along with the budget. Now, it is presented one day or<br>
a few days before the presentation of the budget. This report is<br>
prepared by the finance ministry and indicates the status of the<br>
national economy.<br>
2. General Discussion<br>
The general discussion on budget begins a few days after its<br>
presentation. It takes place in both the Houses of Parliament and<br>
lasts usually for three to four days.<br>
During this stage, the Lok Sabha can discuss the budget as a<br>
whole or on any question of principle involved therein but no cut<br>
motion can be moved nor can the budget be submitted to the vote<br>
of the House. The finance minister has a general right of reply at<br>
the end of the discussion.<br>
3. Scrutiny by Departmental Committees<br>
After the general discussion on the budget is over, the Houses are<br>
adjourned for about three to four weeks. During this gap period,<br>
the 24 departmental standing committees of Parliament examine<br>
and discuss in detail the demands for grants of the concerned<br>
ministers and prepare reports on them. These reports are<br>
submitted to both the Houses of Parliament for consideration.<br>
The standing committee system established in 1993 (and<br>
expanded in 2004) makes parliamentary financial control over<br>
ministries much more detailed, close, in-depth and<br>
comprehensive.<br>
4. Voting on Demands for Grants<br>
In the light of the reports of the departmental standing<br>
committees, the Lok Sabha takes up voting of demands for<br>
grants. The demands are presented ministrywise. A demand<br>
becomes a grant after it has been duly voted.<br>
Two points should be noted in this context. One, the voting of<br>
demands for grants is the exclusive privilege of the Lok Sabha,<br>
that is, the Rajya Sabha has no power of voting the demands.<br>
Second, the voting is confined to the votable part of the budget–<br>
the expenditure charged on the Consolidated Fund of India is not<br>
submitted to the vote (it can only be discussed).<br>
Each demand is voted separately by the Lok Sabha. During this<br>
stage, the members of Parliament can discuss the details of the<br>
budget. They can also move motions to reduce any demand for<br>
grant. Such motions are called as ‘cut motion’, which are of three<br>
kinds:<br>
(a) Policy Cut Motion<br>
It represents the disapproval of the policy underlying the demand.<br>
It states that the amount of the demand be reduced to Re 1. The<br>
members can also advocate an alternative policy.<br>
(b) Economy Cut Motion<br>
It represents the economy that can be affected in the proposed<br>
expenditure. It states that the amount of the demand be reduced<br>
by a specified amount (which may be either a lumpsum reduction<br>
in the demand or ommission or reduction of an item in the<br>
demand).<br>
(c) Token Cut Motion<br>
It ventilates a specific grievance that is within the sphere of<br>
responsibility of the Government of India. It states that the amount<br>
of the demand be reduced by ₹100.<br>
A cut motion, to be admissible, must satisfy the following<br>
conditions:<br>
(i) It should relate to one demand only.<br>
(ii) It should be clearly expressed and should not contain<br>
arguments or defamatory statements.<br>
(iii) It should be confined to one specific matter.<br>
(iv) It should not make suggestions for the amendment or repeal<br>
of existing laws.<br>
(v) It should not refer to a matter that is not primarily the<br>
concern of Union government.<br>
(vi) It should not relate to the expenditure charged on the<br>
Consolidated Fund of India.<br>
(vii) It should not relate to a matter that is under adjudication by a<br>
court.<br>
(viii) It should not raise a question of privilege.<br>
(ix) It should not revive discussion on a matter on which a<br>
decision has been taken in the same session.<br>
(x) It should not relate to a trivial matter.<br>
(xi) It should not reflect on the character or conduct of any<br>
person whose conduct can only be challenged on a<br>
substantive motion.<br>
(xii) It should not anticipate a matter which has been previously<br>
appointed for consideration in the same session.<br>
(xiii) It should not seek to raise a discussion on a matter pending<br>
before any statutory tribunal or statutory authority performing<br>
judicial or quasi-judicial functions or any commission or court<br>
of enquiry.<br>
The significance of a cut motion lies in: (a) facilitating the<br>
initiation of concentrated discussion on a specific demand for<br>
grant; and (b) upholding the principle of responsible government<br>
by probing the activities of the government. However, the cut<br>
motion do not have much utility in practice. They are only moved<br>
and discussed in the House but not passed as the government<br>
enjoys majority support. Their passage by the Lok Sabha amounts<br>
to the expressions of want of parliamentary confidence in the<br>
government and may lead to its resignation.<br>
On the last day of the days allotted for discussion and voting on<br>
the demands for grants, the Speaker puts all the remaining<br>
demands to vote and disposes them whether they have been<br>
discussed by the members or not. This is known as ‘guillotine’.<br>
5. Passing of Appropriation Bill<br>
The Constitution states that ‘no money shall be withdrawn from<br>
the Consolidated Fund of India except under appropriation made<br>
by law’. Accordingly, an appropriation bill is introduced to provide<br>
for the appropriation, out of the Consolidated Fund of India, all<br>
money required to meet:<br>
(a) The grants voted by the Lok Sabha.<br>
(b) The expenditure charged on the Consolidated Fund of India.<br>
No such amendment can be proposed to the appropriation bill<br>
in either house of the Parliament that will have the effect of<br>
varying the amount or altering the destination of any grant voted,<br>
or of varying the amount of any expenditure charged on the<br>
Consolidated Fund of India.<br>
The Appropriation Bill becomes the Appropriation Act after it is<br>
assented to by the President. This act authorises (or legalises) the<br>
payments from the Consolidated Fund of India. This means that<br>
the government cannot withdraw money from the Consolidated<br>
Fund of India till the enactment of the appropriation bill. This takes<br>
time and usually goes on till the end of April. But the government<br>
needs money to carry on its normal activities after 31 March (the<br>
end of the financial year). To overcome this functional difficulty, the<br>
Constitution has authorised the Lok Sabha to make any grant in<br>
advance in respect to the estimated expenditure for a part of the<br>
financial year, pending the completion of the voting of the<br>
demands for grants and the enactment of the appropriation bill.<br>
This provision is known as the ‘vote on account’. It is passed (or<br>
granted) after the general discussion on budget is over. It is<br>
generally granted for two months for an amount equivalent to onesixth<br>
of the total estimation.<br>
6. Passing of Finance Bill<br>
The Finance Bill is introduced to give effect to the financial<br>
proposals of the Government of India for the following year. It is<br>
subjected to all the conditions applicable to a Money Bill. Unlike<br>
the Appropriation Bill, the amendments (seeking to reject or<br>
reduce a tax) can be moved in the case of finance bill.<br>
According to the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act of 1931,<br>
the Finance Bill must be enacted (i.e., passed by the Parliament<br>
and assented to by the president) within 75 days.<br>
The Finance Act legalises the income side of the budget and<br>
completes the process of the enactment of the budget.<br>
Other Grants<br>
In addition to the budget that contains the ordinary estimates of<br>
income and expenditure for one financial year, various other<br>
grants are made by the Parliament under extraordinary or special<br>
circumstances:<br>
Supplementary Grant<br>
It is granted when the amount authorised by the Parliament<br>
through the appropriation act for a particular service for the<br>
current financial year is found to be insufficient for that year.<br>
Additional Grant<br>
It is granted when a need has arisen during the current financial<br>
year for additional expenditure upon some new service not<br>
contemplated in the budget for that year.<br>
Excess Grant<br>
It is granted when money has been spent on any service during a<br>
financial year in excess of the amount granted for that service in<br>
the budget for that year. It is voted by the Lok Sabha after the<br>
financial year. Before the demands for excess grants are<br>
submitted to the Lok Sabha for voting, they must be approved by<br>
the Public Accounts Committee of Parliament.<br>
Vote of Credit<br>
It is granted for meeting an unexpected demand upon the<br>
resources of India, when on account of the magnitude or the<br>
indefinite character of the service, the demand cannot be stated<br>
with the details ordinarily given in a budget. Hence, it is like a<br>
blank cheque given to the Executive by the Lok Sabha.<br>
Exceptional Grant<br>
It is granted for a special purpose and forms no part of the current<br>
service of any financial year.<br>
Token Grant<br>
It is granted when funds to meet the proposed expenditure on a<br>
new service can be made available by reappropriation. A demand<br>
for the grant of a token sum (of Re 1) is submitted to the vote of<br>
the Lok Sabha and if assented, funds are made available.<br>
Reappropriation involves transfer of funds from one head to<br>
another. It does not involve any additional expenditure.<br>
Supplementary, additional, excess and exceptional grants and<br>
vote of credit are regulated by the same procedure which is<br>
applicable in the case of a regular budget.<br>
Funds<br>
The Constitution of India provides for the following three kinds of<br>
funds for the Central government:</p>
<ol>
<li>Consolidated Fund of India (Article 266)</li>
<li>Public Account of India (Article 266)</li>
<li>Contingency Fund of India (Article 267)<br>
Consolidated Fund of India<br>
It is a fund to which all receipts are credited and all payments are<br>
debited. In other words, (a) all revenues received by the<br>
Government of India; (b) all loans raised by the Government by<br>
the issue of treasury bills, loans or ways and means of advances;<br>
and (c) all money received by the government in repayment of<br>
loans forms the Consolidated Fund of India. All the legally<br>
authorised payments on behalf of the Government of India are<br>
made out of this fund. No money out of this fund can be<br>
appropriated (issued or drawn) except in accordance with a<br>
parliamentary law.<br>
Public Account of India<br>
All other public money (other than those which are credited to the<br>
Consolidated Fund of India) received by or on behalf of the<br>
Government of India shall be credited to the Public Account of<br>
India. This includes provident fund deposits, judicial deposits,<br>
savings bank deposits, departmental deposits, remittances and so<br>
on. This account is operated by executive action, that is, the<br>
payments from this account can by made without parliamentary<br>
appropriation. Such payments are mostly in the nature of banking<br>
transactions.<br>
Contingency Fund of India<br>
The Constitution authorised the Parliament to establish a<br>
‘Contingency Fund of India’, into which amounts determined by<br>
law are paid from time to time. Accordingly, the Parliament<br>
enacted the contingency fund of India Act in 1950. This fund is<br>
placed at the disposal of the president, and he can make<br>
advances out of it to meet unforeseen expenditure pending its<br>
authorisation by the Parliament. The fund is held by the finance<br>
secretary on behalf of the president. Like the public account of<br>
India, it is also operated by executive action.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="multifunctional--role-of--parliament">MULTIFUNCTIONAL  ROLE OF  PARLIAMENT </h1>
<p>In the ‘Indian politico-administrative system’, the Parliament<br>
occupies a central position and has a multifunctional role. It enjoys<br>
extensive powers and performs a variety of functions towards the<br>
fulfilment of its constitutionally expected role. Its powers and<br>
functions can be classified under the following heads:</p>
<ol>
<li>Legislative Powers and Functions</li>
<li>Executive Powers and Functions</li>
<li>Financial Powers and Functions</li>
<li>Constituent Powers and Functions</li>
<li>Judicial Powers and Functions</li>
<li>Electoral Powers and Functions</li>
<li>Other powers and functions.</li>
<li>Legislative Powers and Functions<br>
The primary function of Parliament is to make laws for the<br>
governance of the country. It has exclusive power to make laws on<br>
the subjects enumerated in the Union List (which at present has<br>
98 subjects, originally 97 subjects) and on the residuary subjects<br>
(that is, subjects not enumerated in any of the three lists). With<br>
regard to Concurrent List (which has at present 52 subjects,<br>
originally 47 subjects), the Parliament has overriding powers, that<br>
is, the law of Parliament prevails over the law of the state<br>
legislature in case of a conflict between the two.<br>
The Constitution also empowers the Parliament to make laws<br>
on the subjects enumerated in the State List (which at present has<br>
59 subjects, originally 66 subjects) under the following five<br>
abnormal circumstances:<br>
(a) when Rajya Sabha passes a resolution to that effect.<br>
(b) when a proclamation of National Emergency is in operation.<br>
(c) when two or more states make a joint request to the<br>
Parliament.<br>
(d) when necessary to give effect to international agreements,<br>
treaties and conventions.<br>
(e) when President’s Rule is in operation in the state.<br>
All the ordinances issued by the president (during the recess of<br>
the Parliament) must be approved by the Parliament within six<br>
weeks after its reassembly. An ordinance becomes inoperative if it<br>
is not approved by the parliament within that period.<br>
The Parliament makes laws in a skeleton form and authorises<br>
the Executive to make detailed rules and regulations within the<br>
framework of the parent law. This is known as delegated<br>
legislation or executive legislation or subordinate legislation. Such<br>
rules and regulations are placed before the Parliament for its<br>
examination.</li>
<li>Executive Powers and Functions<br>
The Constitution of India established a parliamentary form of<br>
government in which the Executive is responsible to the<br>
Parliament for its policies and acts. Hence, the Parliament<br>
exercises control over the Executive through question-hour, zero<br>
hour, half-an-hour discussion, short duration discussion, calling<br>
attention motion, adjournment motion, no-confidence motion,<br>
censure motion and other discussions. It also supervises the<br>
activities of the Executive with the help of its committees like<br>
committee on government assurance, committee on subordinate<br>
legislation, committee on petitions, etc.<br>
The ministers are collectively responsible to the Parliament in<br>
general and to the Lok Sabha in particular. As a part of collective<br>
responsibility, there is individual responsibility, that is, each<br>
minister is individually responsible for the efficient administration<br>
of the ministry under his charge. This means that they continue in<br>
office so long as they enjoy the confidence of the majority<br>
members in the Lok Sabha. In other words, the council of<br>
ministers can be removed from office by the Lok Sabha by<br>
passing a noconfidence motion. The Lok Sabha can also express<br>
lack of confidence in the government in the following ways:<br>
(a) By not passing a motion of thanks on the President’s<br>
inaugural address.<br>
(b) By rejecting a money bill.<br>
(c) By passing a censure motion or an adjournment motion.<br>
(d) By defeating the government on a vital issue.<br>
(e) By passing a cut motion.<br>
Therefore, “the first function of Parliament can be said to be to<br>
select the group which is to form the government, support and<br>
sustain it in power so long as it enjoys its confidence, and to expel<br>
it when it ceases to do so, and leave it to the people to decide at<br>
the next general election.”23</li>
<li>Financial Powers and Functions<br>
No tax can be levied or collected and no expenditure can be<br>
incurred by the Executive except under the authority and with the<br>
approval of Parliament. Hence, the budget is placed before the<br>
Parliament for its approval. The enactment of the budget by the<br>
Parliament legalises the receipts and expenditure of the<br>
government for the ensuing financial year.<br>
The Parliament also scrutinises government spending and<br>
financial performance with the help of its financial committees.<br>
These include public accounts committee, estimates committee<br>
and committee on public undertakings. They bring out the cases<br>
of illegal, irregular, unauthorised, improper usage and wastage<br>
and extravagance in public expenditure.<br>
Therefore, the parliamentary control over the Executive in<br>
financial matters operates in two stages:<br>
(a) budgetary control, that is, control before the appropriation of<br>
grants through the enactment of the budget; and<br>
(b) post-budgetary control, that is, control after the appropriation<br>
of grants through the three financial committees.<br>
The budget is based on the principle of annuity, that is, the<br>
Parliament grants money to the government for one financial year.<br>
If the granted money is not spent by the end of the financial year,<br>
then the balance expires and returns to the Consolidated Fund of<br>
India. This practice is known as the ‘rule of lapse’. It facilitates<br>
effective financial control by the Parliament as no reserve funds<br>
can be built without its authorisation. However, the observance of<br>
this rule leads to heavy rush of expenditure towards the close of<br>
the financial year. This is popularly called as ‘March Rush’.</li>
<li>Constituent Powers and Functions<br>
The Parliament is vested with the powers to amend the<br>
Constitution by way of addition, variation or repeal of any<br>
provision. The major part of the Constitution can be amended by<br>
the Parliament with special majority, that is, a majority of the total<br>
membership of each House and a majority of not less than twothirds<br>
of the members present and voting in each House. Some<br>
other provisions of the Constitution can be amended by the<br>
Parliament with simple majority, that is, a majority of the members<br>
present and voting in each House of Parliament. Only a few<br>
provisions of the Constitution can be amended by the Parliament<br>
(by special majority) and with the consent of at least half of the<br>
state Legislatures (by simple majority). However, the power to<br>
initiate the process of the amendment of the Constitution (in all the<br>
three cases) lies exclusively in the hands of the Parliament and<br>
not the state legislature. There is only one exception, that is, the<br>
state legislature can pass a resolution requesting the Parliament<br>
for the creation or abolition of the legislative council in the state.<br>
Based on the resolution, the Parliament makes an act for<br>
amending the Constitution to that effect. To sum up, the<br>
Parliament can amend the Constitution in three ways:<br>
(a) By simple majority;<br>
(b) By special majority; and<br>
(c) By special majority but with the consent of half of all the state<br>
legislatures.<br>
The constituent power of the Parliament is not unlimited; it is<br>
subject to the ‘basic structure’ of the Constitution. In others words,<br>
the Parliament can amend any provision of the Constitution<br>
except the ‘basic features’ of the Constitution. This was ruled by<br>
the Supreme Court in the Kesavananda Bharati case (1973) and<br>
reaffirmed in the Minerva Mills case (1980)24 .</li>
<li>Judicial Powers and Functions<br>
The judicial powers and functions of the Parliament include the<br>
following:<br>
(a) It can impeach the President for the violation of the<br>
Constitution.<br>
(b) It can remove the Vice-President from his office.<br>
(c) It can recommend the removal of judges (including chief<br>
justice) of the Supreme Court and the high courts, chief<br>
election commissioner, comptroller and auditor general to the<br>
president.<br>
(d) It can punish its members or outsiders for the breach of its<br>
privileges or its contempt.</li>
<li>Electoral Powers and Functions<br>
The Parliament participates in the election of the President (along<br>
with the state legislative assemblies) and elects the Vice-<br>
President. The Lok Sabha elects its Speaker and Deputy Speaker,<br>
while the Rajya Sabha elects its Deputy Chairman.<br>
The Parliament is also authorised to make laws to regulate the<br>
elections to the offices of President and Vice-President, to both<br>
the Houses of Parliament and to both the Houses of state<br>
legislature. Accordingly, Parliament enacted the Presidential and<br>
Vice-Presidential Election Act (1952), the Representation of<br>
People Act (1950), the Representation of People Act (1951), etc.</li>
<li>Other Powers and Functions<br>
The various other powers and functions of the Parliament include:<br>
(a) It serves as the highest deliberative body in the country. It<br>

(b) It approves all the three types of emergencies (national, state<br>

(c) It can create or abolish the state legislative councils on the<br>
recommendation of the concerned state legislative<br>

(d) It can increase or decrease the area, alter the boundaries<br>

<h1 id="ineffectiveness-of--parliamentary--control">INEFFECTIVENESS OF  PARLIAMENTARY  CONTROL </h1>
<p>The parliamentary control over government and administration in<br>
India is more theoretical than practical. In reality, the control is not<br>
as effective as it ought to be. The following factors are responsible<br>
for this:<br>
(a) The Parliament has neither time nor expertise to control the<br>
administration which has grown in volume as well as<br>
complexity.<br>
(b) Parliament’s financial control is hindered by the technical<br>
nature of the demands for grants. The parliamentarians being<br>
laymen cannot understand them properly and fully.<br>
(c) The legislative leadership lies with the Executive and it plays<br>
a significant role in formulating policies.<br>
(d) The very size of the Parliament is too large and<br>
unmanagable to be effective.<br>
(e) The majority support enjoyed by the Executive in the<br>
Parliament reduces the possibility of effective criticism.<br>
(f) The financial committees like Public Accounts Committee<br>
examines the public expenditure after it has been incurred by<br>
the Executive. Thus, they do post mortem work.<br>
(g) The increased recourse to ‘guillotine’ reduced the scope of<br>
financial control.<br>
(h) The growth of ‘delegated legislation’ has reduced the role of<br>
Parliament in making detailed laws and has increased the<br>
powers of bureaucracy.<br>
(i) The frequent promulgation of ordinances by the president<br>
dilutes the Parliament’s power of legislation.<br>
(j) The Parliament’s control is sporadic, general and mostly<br>
political in nature.<br>
(k) Lack of strong and steady opposition in the Parliament, and a<br>
setback in the parliamentary behaviour and ethics, have also<br>
contributed to the ineffectiveness of legislative control over<br>
administration in India.</p>
<h1 id="position-of--rajya--sabha">POSITION OF  RAJYA  SABHA </h1>
<p>The Constitutional position of the Rajya Sabha (as compared with<br>
the Lok Sabha) can be studied from three angles:</p>
<ol>
<li>Where Rajya Sabha is equal to Lok Sabha.</li>
<li>Where Rajya Sabha is unequal to Lok Sabha.</li>
<li>Where Rajya Sabha has special powers that are not at all<br>
shared with the Lok Sabha.<br>
Equal Status with Lok Sabha<br>
In the following matters, the powers and status of the Rajya<br>
Sabha are equal to that of the Lok Sabha:</li>
<li>Introduction and passage of ordinary bills.</li>
<li>Introduction and passage of Constitutional amendment bills.</li>
<li>Introduction and passage of financial bills involving<br>
expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of India.</li>
<li>Election and impeachment of the president.</li>
<li>Election and removal of the Vice-President. However, Rajya<br>
Sabha alone can initiate the removal of the vice-president.<br>
He is removed by a resolution passed by the Rajya Sabha<br>
by an effective majority (which is a type of special majority)<br>
and agreed to by the Lok Sabha by a simple majority.</li>
<li>Making recommendation to the President for the removal of<br>
Chief Justice and judges of Supreme Court and high courts,<br>
chief election commissioner and comptroller and auditor<br>
general.</li>
<li>Approval of ordinances issued by the President.</li>
<li>Approval of proclamation of all three types of emergencies<br>
by the President.</li>
<li>Selection of ministers including the Prime Minister. Under<br>
the Constitution, the ministers including the Prime Minister<br>
can be members of either House. However, irrespective of<br>
their membership, they are responsible only to the Lok<br>
Sabha.</li>
<li>Consideration of the reports of the constitutional bodies like<br>
Finance Commission, Union Public Service Commission,<br>
comptroller and auditor general, etc.</li>
<li>Enlargement of the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and<br>
the Union Public Service Commission.<br>
Unequal Status with Lok Sabha<br>
In the following matters, the powers and status of the Rajya<br>
Sabha are unequal to that of the Lok Sabha:</li>
<li>A Money Bill can be introduced only in the Lok Sabha and<br>
not in the Rajya Sabha.</li>
<li>Rajya Sabha cannot amend or reject a Money Bill. It should<br>
return the bill to the Lok Sabha within 14 days, either with<br>
recommendations or without recommendations.</li>
<li>The Lok Sabha can either accept or reject all or any of the<br>
recommendations of the Rajya Sabha. In both the cases, the<br>
money bill is deemed to have been passed by the two<br>
Houses.</li>
<li>A financial bill, not containing solely the matters of Article<br>
110, also can be introduced only in the Lok Sabha and not in<br>
the Rajya Sabha. But, with regard to its passage, both the<br>
Houses have equal powers.</li>
<li>The final power to decide whether a particular bill is a Money<br>
Bill or not is vested in the Speaker of the Lok Sabha.</li>
<li>The Speaker of Lok Sabha presides over the joint sitting of<br>
both the Houses.</li>
<li>The Lok Sabha with greater number wins the battle in a joint<br>
sitting except when the combined strength of the ruling party<br>
in both the Houses is less than that of the opposition parties.</li>
<li>Rajya Sabha can only discuss the budget but cannot vote<br>
on the demands for grants (which is the exclusive privilege<br>
of the Lok Sabha).</li>
<li>A resolution for the discontinuance of the national<br>
emergency can be passed only by the Lok Sabha and not by<br>
the Rajya Sabha.</li>
<li>The Rajya Sabha cannot remove the council of ministers by<br>
passing a no-confidence motion. This is because the Council<br>
of ministers is collectively responsible only to the Lok Sabha.<br>
But, the Rajya Sabha can discuss and criticise the policies<br>
and activities of the government.<br>
Special Powers of Rajya Sabha<br>
The Rajya Sabha has been given four exclusive or special powers<br>
that are not enjoyed by the Lok Sabha:</li>
<li>It can authorise the Parliament to make a law on a subject<br>
enumerated in the State List (Article 249).</li>
<li>It can authorise the Parliament to create new All-India<br>
Services common to both the Centre and states (Article<br>
312).</li>
<li>It alone can initiate a move for the removal of the vicepresident.<br>
In other words, a resolution for the removal of the<br>
vice-president can be introduced only in the Rajya Sabha<br>
and not in the Lok Sabha (Article 67).</li>
<li>If a proclamation is issued by the President for imposing<br>
national emergency or president’s rule or financial<br>
emergency at a time when the Lok Sabha has been<br>
dissolved or the dissolution of the Lok Sabha takes place<br>
within the period allowed for its approval, then the<br>
proclamation can remain effective even if it is approved by<br>
the Rajya Sabha alone (Articles 352, 356 and 360).<br>
An analysis of the above points makes it clear that the position<br>
of the Rajya Sabha in our constitutional system is not as weak as<br>
that of the House of Lords in the British constitutional system nor<br>
as strong as that of the Senate in the American constitutional<br>
system. Except in financial matters and control over the council of<br>
ministers, the powers and status of the Rajya Sabha in all other<br>
spheres are broadly equal and coordinate with that of the Lok<br>
Sabha.<br>
Even though the Rajya Sabha has been given less powers as<br>
compared with the Lok Sabha, its utility is supported on the<br>
following grounds:</li>
<li>It checks hasty, defective, careless and ill-considered<br>
legislation made by the Lok Sabha by making provision of<br>
revision and thought.</li>
<li>It facilitates giving representation to eminent professionals<br>
and experts who cannot face the direct election. The<br>
President nominates 12 such persons to the Rajya Sabha.</li>
<li>It maintains the federal equilibrium by protecting the<br>
interests of the states against the undue interference of the<br>
Centre.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="parliamentary--privileges">PARLIAMENTARY  PRIVILEGES </h1>
<p>Meaning<br>
Parliamentary privileges are special rights, immunities and<br>
exemptions enjoyed by the two Houses of Parliament, their<br>
committees and their members. They are necessary in order to<br>
secure the independence and effectiveness of their actions.<br>
Without these privileges, the Houses can neither maintain their<br>
authority, dignity and honour nor can protect their members from<br>
any obstruction in the discharge of their parliamentary<br>
responsibilities.<br>
The Constitution has also extended the parliamentary privileges<br>
to those persons who are entitled to speak and take part in the<br>
proceedings of a House of Parliament or any of its committees.<br>
These include the attorney general of India and Union ministers.<br>
It must be clarified here that the parliamentary privileges do not<br>
extend to the president who is also an integral part of the<br>
Parliament.<br>
Classification<br>
Parliamentary privileges can be classified into two broad<br>
categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>those that are enjoyed by each House of Parliament<br>
collectively, and</li>
<li>those that are enjoyed by the members individually.<br>
Collective Privileges<br>
The privileges belonging to each House of Parliament collectively<br>
are:</li>
<li>It has the right to publish its reports, debates and<br>
proceedings and also the right to prohibit others from<br>
publishing the same. The 44th Amendment Act of 1978<br>
restored the freedom of the press to publish true reports of<br>
parliamentary proceedings without prior permission of the<br>
House. But this is not applicable in the case of a secret<br>
sitting of the House.</li>
<li>It can exclude strangers from its proceedings and hold<br>
secret sittings to discuss some important matters.</li>
<li>It can make rules to regulate its own procedure and the<br>
conduct of its business and to adjudicate upon such matters.</li>
<li>It can punish members as well as outsiders for breach of its<br>
privileges or its contempt by reprimand, admonition or<br>
imprisonment (also suspension or expulsion, in case of<br>
members).25</li>
<li>It has the right to receive immediate information of the<br>
arrest, detention, conviction, imprisonment and release of a<br>
member.</li>
<li>It can institute inquiries and order the attendance of<br>
witnesses and send for relevant papers and records.</li>
<li>The courts are prohibited to inquire into the proceedings of a<br>
House or its committees.</li>
<li>No person (either a member or outsider) can be arrested,<br>
and no legal process (civil or criminal) can be served within<br>
the precincts of the House without the permission of the<br>
presiding officer.<br>
Individual Privileges<br>
The privileges belonging to the members individually are:</li>
<li>They cannot be arrested during the session of Parliament<br>
and 40 days before the beginning and 40 days after the end<br>
of a session. This privilege is available only in civil cases<br>
and not in criminal cases or preventive detention cases.</li>
<li>They have freedom of speech in Parliament. No member is<br>
liable to any proceedings in any court for anything said or<br>
any vote given by him in Parliament or its committees. This<br>
freedom is subject to the provisions of the Constitution and<br>
to the rules and standing orders regulating the procedure of<br>
Parliament.26</li>
<li>They are exempted from jury service. They can refuse to<br>
give evidence and appear as a witness in a case pending in<br>
a court when Parliament is in session.<br>
Breach of Privilege and Contempt of the House<br>
“When any individual or authority disregards or attacks any of<br>
the privileges, rights and immunities, either of the member<br>
individually or of the House in its collective capacity, the offence<br>
is termed as breach of privilege and is punishable by the<br>
House.”27<br>
Any act or omission which obstructs a House of Parliament, its<br>
member or its officer in the performance of their functions or which<br>
has a tendency, directly or indirectly to produce results against the<br>
dignity, authority and honour of the House is treated as a<br>
contempt of the House.28<br>
Though the two phrases, ‘breach of privilege’ and ‘contempt of<br>
the House’ are used interchangeably, they have different<br>
implications. ‘Normally, a breach of privilege may amount to<br>
contempt of the House. Likewise, contempt of the House may<br>
include a breach of privilege also. Contempt of the House,<br>
however, has wider implications. There may be a contempt of the<br>
House without specifically committing a breach of privilege’.29<br>
Similarly, ‘actions which are not breaches of any specific privilege<br>
but are offences against the dignity and authority of the House<br>
amount to contempt of the House’.30 For example, disobedience<br>
to a legitimate order of the House is not a breach of privilege, but<br>
can be punished as contempt of the House.<br>
Sources of Privileges<br>
Originally, the Constitution (Article 105) expressedly mentioned<br>
two privileges, that is, freedom of speech in Parliament and right<br>
of publication of its proceedings. With regard to other privileges, it<br>
provided that they were to be the same as those of the British<br>
House of Commons, its committees and its members on the date<br>
of its commencement (ie, 26 January, 1950), until defined by<br>
Parliament. The 44th Amendment Act of 1978 provided that the<br>
other privileges of each House of Parliament, its committees and<br>
its members are to be those which they had on the date of its<br>
commencement (ie, 20 June, 1979), until defined by Parliament.<br>
This means that the position with regard to other privileges<br>
remains same. In other words, the amendment has made only<br>
verbal changes by dropping a direct reference to the British House<br>
of Commons, without making any change in the implication of the<br>
provision.31<br>
It should be noted here that the Parliament, till now, has not<br>
made any special law to exhaustively codify all the privileges.<br>
They are based on five sources, namely,</li>
<li>Constitutional provisions,</li>
<li>Various laws made by Parliament,</li>
<li>Rules of both the Houses,</li>
<li>Parliamentary conventions, and</li>
<li>Judicial interpretations.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="sovereignty-of--parliament">SOVEREIGNTY OF  PARLIAMENT </h1>
<p>The doctrine of ‘sovereignty of Parliament’ is associated with the<br>
British Parliament. Sovereignty means the supreme power within<br>
the State. That supreme power in Great Britain lies with the<br>
Parliament. There are no ‘legal’ restrictions on its authority and<br>
jurisdiction.<br>
Therefore, the sovereignty of Parliament (parliamentary<br>
supremacy) is a cardinal feature of the British constitutional<br>
system. According to AV Dicey, the British jurist, this principle has<br>
three implications:32</p>
<ol>
<li>The Parliament can make, amend, substitute or repeal any<br>
law. De Lolme, a British political analyst, said, ‘The British<br>
Parliament can do every thing except make a woman a man<br>
and a man a woman’.</li>
<li>The Parliament can make constitutional laws by the same<br>
procedure as ordinary laws. In other words, there is no legal<br>
distinction between the constituent authority and the<br>
legislative authority of the British Parliament.</li>
<li>The Parliamentary laws cannot be declared invalid by the<br>
Judiciary as being unconstitutional. In other words, there is<br>
no system of judicial review in Britain.<br>
The Indian Parliament, on the other hand, cannot be regarded<br>
as a sovereign body in the similar sense as there are ‘legal’<br>
restrictions on its authority and jurisdiction. The factors that limit<br>
the sovereignty of Indian Parliament are:</li>
<li>Written Nature of the Constitution<br>
The Constitution is the fundamental law of the land in our country.<br>
It has defined the authority and jurisdiction of all the three organs<br>
of the Union government and the nature of interrelationship<br>
between them. Hence, the Parliament has to operate within the<br>
limits prescribed by the Constitution. There is also a legal<br>
distinction between the legislative authority and the constituent<br>
authority of the Parliament. Moreover, to effect certain<br>
amendments to the Constitution, the ratification of half of the<br>
states is also required. In Britain, on the other hand, the<br>
Constitution is neither written nor there is anything like a<br>
fundamental law of the land.</li>
<li>Federal System of Government<br>
India has a federal system of government with a constitutional<br>
division of powers between the Union and the states. Both have to<br>
operate within the spheres allotted to them. Hence, the lawmaking<br>
authority of the Parliament gets confined to the subjects<br>
enumerated in the Union List and Concurrent List and does not<br>
extend to the subjects enumerated in the State List (except in five<br>
abnormal circumstances and that too for a short period). Britain,<br>
on the other hand, has a unitary system of government and<br>
hence, all the powers are vested in the Centre.</li>
<li>System of Judicial Review<br>
The adoption of an independent Judiciary with the power of<br>
judicial review also restricts the supremacy of our Parliament.<br>
Both the Supreme Court and high courts can declare the laws<br>
enacted by the Parliament as void and ultra vires<br>
(unconstitutional), if they contravene any provision of the<br>
Constitution. On the other hand, there is no system of judicial<br>
review in Britain. The British Courts have to apply the<br>
Parliamentary laws to specific cases, without examining their<br>
constitutionality, legality or reasonableness.</li>
<li>Fundamental Rights<br>
The authority of the Parliament is also restricted by the<br>
incorporation of a code of justiciable fundamental rights under<br>
Part III of the Constitution. Article 13 prohibits the State from<br>
making a law that either takes away totally or abrogates in part a<br>
fundamental right. Hence, a Parliamentary law that contravenes<br>
the fundamental rights shall be void. In Britain, on the other hand,<br>
there is no codification of justiciable fundamental rights in the<br>
Constitution. The British Parliament has also not made any law<br>
that lays down the fundamental rights of the citizens. However, it<br>
does not mean that the British citizens do not have rights. Though<br>
there is no charter guaranteeing rights, there is maximum liberty in<br>
Britain due to the existence of the Rule of Law.<br>
Therefore, even though the nomenclature and organisational<br>
pattern of our Parliament is similar to that of the British<br>
Parliament, there is a substantial difference between the two. The<br>
Indian Parliament is not a sovereign body in the sense in which<br>
the British Parliament is a sovereign body. Unlike the British<br>
Parliament, the authority and jurisdiction of the Indian Parliament<br>
are defined, limited and restrained.<br>
In this regard, the Indian Parliament is similar to the American<br>
Legislature (known as Congress). In USA also, the sovereignty of<br>
Congress is legally restricted by the written character of the<br>
Constitution, the federal system of government, the system of<br>
judicial review and the Bill of Rights.</li>
