    <h1 id="governor">31 - Governor</h1>
<p>The <strong>Constitution of India</strong> envisages the same pattern
of government in the states as that for the Centre, that is, a
<strong>parliamentary system</strong>. <strong>Part VI</strong> of the
Constitution deals with the government in the states. <strong>Articles
153 to 167</strong> in <strong>Part VI</strong> of the Constitution deal
with the state executive. The state executive consists of the
<strong>governor</strong>, the <strong>chief minister</strong>, the
<strong>council of ministers</strong> and the <strong>advocate
general</strong> of the state. Thus, there is no office of
<strong>vice-governor</strong> (in the state) like that of
<strong>Vice-President</strong> at the Centre.</p>
<p>The <strong>governor</strong> is the <strong>chief executive head of
the state</strong>. But, like the president, he is a nominal executive
head (titular or constitutional head). The governor also acts as an
agent of the <strong>central government</strong>. Therefore, the office
of governor has a <strong>dual role</strong>.</p>
<p>Usually, there is a governor for each state, but the <strong>7th
Constitutional Amendment Act of 1956</strong> facilitated the
appointment of the same person as a governor for two or more states.</p>
<h2 id="appointment-of-governor">APPOINTMENT OF GOVERNOR</h2>
<p>The <strong>governor</strong> is neither directly elected by the
people nor indirectly elected by a specially constituted electoral
college as is the case with the president. He is appointed by the
<strong>president</strong> by warrant under his hand and seal. In a way,
he is a nominee of the <strong>Central government</strong>. But, as held
by the <strong>Supreme Court</strong> in <strong>1979</strong>, the
office of governor of a state is not an employment under the Central
government. It is an independent constitutional office and is not under
the control of or subordinate to the Central government.</p>
<p>The <strong>Draft Constitution</strong> provided for the direct
election of the governor on the basis of universal adult suffrage. But
the <strong>Constituent Assembly</strong> opted for the present system
of appointment of governor by the president because of the following
reasons:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The direct election of the governor is incompatible with the
<strong>parliamentary system</strong> established in the states.</li>
<li>The mode of direct election is more likely to create conflicts
between the governor and the <strong>chief minister</strong>.</li>
<li>The governor being only a <strong>constitutional (nominal)
head</strong>, there is no point in making elaborate arrangements for
his election and spending huge amount of money.</li>
<li>The election of a governor would be entirely on personal issues.
Hence, it is not in the <strong>national interest</strong> to involve a
large number of voters in such an election.</li>
<li>An elected governor would naturally belong to a party and would not
be a neutral person and an impartial head.</li>
<li>The election of governor would create <strong>separatist
tendencies</strong> and thus affect the political stability and unity of
the country.</li>
<li>The system of <strong>presidential nomination</strong> enables the
Centre to maintain its control over the states.</li>
<li>The direct election of the governor creates a serious problem of
leadership at the time of a <strong>general election</strong> in the
state.</li>
<li>The <strong>chief minister</strong> would like his nominee to
contest for governorship. Hence, a second rate man of the ruling party
is elected as governor.</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, the <strong>American model</strong>, where the Governor of
a state is directly elected, was dropped and the <strong>Canadian
model</strong>, where the governor of a province (state) is appointed by
the Governor-General (Centre), was accepted in the Constituent
Assembly.</p>
<p>The Constitution lays down only two qualifications for the
appointment of a person as a governor. These are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>He should be a <strong>citizen of India</strong>.</li>
<li>He should have completed the age of <strong>35 years</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, two conventions have also developed in this regard over
the years. First, he should be an <strong>outsider</strong>, that is, he
should not belong to the state where he is appointed, so that he is free
from the local politics. Second, while appointing the governor, the
president is required to consult the <strong>chief minister</strong> of
the state concerned, so that the smooth functioning of the
constitutional machinery in the state is ensured. However, both the
conventions have been violated in some of the cases.</p>
<h2 id="conditions-of-governors-office">CONDITIONS OF GOVERNOR’S
OFFICE</h2>
<p>The Constitution lays down the following conditions for the
governor’s office:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>He should not be a member of either <strong>House of
Parliament</strong> or a <strong>House of the state
legislature</strong>. If any such person is appointed as governor, he is
deemed to have vacated his seat in that House on the date on which he
enters upon his office as the governor.</li>
<li>He should not hold any other <strong>office of profit</strong>.</li>
<li>He is entitled without payment of rent to the use of his official
residence (the <strong>Raj Bhavan</strong>).</li>
<li>He is entitled to such <strong>emoluments, allowances and
privileges</strong> as may be determined by Parliament.</li>
<li>When the same person is appointed as the governor of two or more
states, the emoluments and allowances payable to him are shared by the
states in such proportion as determined by the president.</li>
<li>His emoluments and allowances <strong>cannot be diminished during
his term of office</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>In <strong>2018</strong>, the Parliament increased the salary of the
governor from <strong>₹1.10 lakh to ₹3.50 lakh</strong> per month.</p>
<p>Like the President, the governor is also entitled to a number of
privileges and immunities. He enjoys <strong>personal immunity from
legal liability</strong> for his official acts. During his term of
office, he is immune from any criminal proceedings, even in respect of
his personal acts. He cannot be arrested or imprisoned. However, after
giving two months’ notice, <strong>civil proceedings</strong> can be
instituted against him during his term of office in respect of his
personal acts.</p>
<p>Before entering upon his office, the governor has to make and
subscribe to an <strong>oath or affirmation</strong>. In his oath, the
governor swears: (a) to <strong>faithfully execute the office</strong>;
(b) to <strong>preserve, protect and defend the Constitution and the
law</strong>; and (c) to <strong>devote himself to the service and
well-being of the people</strong> of the state.</p>
<p>The <strong>oath of office</strong> to the governor is administered
by the <strong>chief justice</strong> of the concerned state high court
and in his absence, the senior-most judge of that court available.</p>
<p>Every person discharging the functions of the governor also
undertakes a similar oath or affirmation.</p>
<h2 id="powers-and-functions-of-governor">POWERS AND FUNCTIONS OF
GOVERNOR</h2>
<p>A governor possesses <strong>executive</strong>,
<strong>legislative</strong>, <strong>financial</strong>, and
<strong>judicial</strong> powers more or less analogous to the President
of India. However, he has no <strong>diplomatic</strong>,
<strong>military</strong>, or <strong>emergency</strong> powers like the
president. The powers and functions of the governor can be studied under
the following heads:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Executive powers</strong></li>
<li><strong>Legislative powers</strong></li>
<li><strong>Financial powers</strong></li>
<li><strong>Judicial powers</strong></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="executive-powers">Executive Powers</h3>
<p>The executive powers and functions of the Governor are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>All <strong>executive actions</strong> of the government of a state
are formally taken in his name.</li>
<li>He can make rules specifying the manner in which the Orders and
other instruments made and executed in his name shall be
authenticated.</li>
<li>He can make rules for more convenient transaction of the business of
a state government and for the allocation among the ministers of the
said business.</li>
<li>He appoints the <strong>chief minister</strong> and other ministers.
They also hold office during his pleasure. There should be a
<strong>Tribal Welfare minister</strong> in the states of
<strong>Chattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh</strong>, and
<strong>Odisha</strong> appointed by him. The state of
<strong>Bihar</strong> was excluded from this provision by the
<strong>94th Amendment Act of 2006</strong>.</li>
<li>He appoints the <strong>advocate general</strong> of a state and
determines his remuneration. The advocate general holds office during
the pleasure of the governor.</li>
<li>He appoints the <strong>state election commissioner</strong> and
determines his conditions of service and tenure of office. However, the
state election commissioner can be removed only in like manner and on
the like grounds as a judge of a high court.</li>
<li>He appoints the chairman and members of the <strong>state public
service commission</strong>. However, they can be removed only by the
president and not by a governor.</li>
<li>He can seek any information relating to the administration of the
affairs of the state and proposals for legislation from the
<strong>chief minister</strong>.</li>
<li>He can require the chief minister to submit for the consideration of
the <strong>council of ministers</strong> any matter on which a decision
has been taken by a minister but which has not been considered by the
council.</li>
<li>He can recommend the imposition of <strong>constitutional
emergency</strong> in a state to the president. During the period of
<strong>President’s rule</strong> in a state, the governor enjoys
extensive executive powers as an agent of the President.</li>
<li>He acts as the <strong>chancellor of universities</strong> in the
state. He also appoints the <strong>vice-chancellors</strong> of
universities in the state.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="legislative-powers">Legislative Powers</h2>
<p>A governor is an <strong>integral part of the state
legislature</strong>. In that capacity, he has the following legislative
powers and functions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>He can <strong>summon or prorogue</strong> the state legislature and
<strong>dissolve</strong> the state legislative assembly.</li>
<li>He can <strong>address the state legislature</strong> at the
commencement of the first session after each general election and the
first session of each year.</li>
<li>He can <strong>send messages</strong> to the house or houses of the
state legislature, with respect to a bill pending in the legislature or
otherwise.</li>
<li>He can appoint any member of the <strong>State legislative
assembly</strong> to preside over its proceedings when the offices of
both the <strong>Speaker</strong> and the <strong>Deputy
Speaker</strong> fall vacant. Similarly, he can appoint any member of
the state legislature council to preside over its proceedings when the
offices of both <strong>Chairman</strong> and <strong>Deputy
Chairman</strong> fall vacant.</li>
<li>He nominates <strong>one-sixth of the members</strong> of the state
legislative council from amongst persons having special knowledge or
practical experience in literature, science, art, cooperative movement,
and social service.</li>
<li>He can nominate <strong>one member</strong> to the state legislature
assembly from the <strong>Anglo-Indian Community</strong>.</li>
<li>He decides on the question of <strong>disqualification of
members</strong> of the state legislature in consultation with the
<strong>Election Commission</strong>.</li>
<li>When a bill is sent to the governor after it is passed by the state
legislature, he can: (a) <strong>Give his assent</strong> to the bill,
or (b) <strong>Withhold his assent</strong> to the bill, or (c)
<strong>Return the bill</strong> (if it is not a money bill) for
reconsideration of the state legislature. However, if the bill is passed
again by the state legislature with or without amendments, the governor
has to give his assent to the bill, or (d) <strong>Reserve the bill for
the consideration of the president</strong>. In one case such
reservation is obligatory, that is, where the bill passed by the state
legislature endangers the position of the state high court. In addition,
the governor can also reserve the bill if it is of the following nature:
(i) <strong>Ultra-vires</strong>, that is, against the provisions of the
Constitution. (ii) Opposed to the <strong>Directive Principles of State
Policy</strong>. (iii) Against the larger interest of the country. (iv)
Of <strong>grave national importance</strong>. (v) Dealing with
compulsory acquisition of property under <strong>Article 31</strong> of
the Constitution.</li>
<li>He can <strong>promulgate ordinances</strong> when the state
legislature is not in session. These ordinances must be approved by the
state legislature within six weeks from its reassembly. He can also
withdraw an ordinance anytime. This is the most important legislative
power of the governor.</li>
<li>He lays the reports of the <strong>State Finance
Commission</strong>, the <strong>State Public Service
Commission</strong>, and the <strong>Comptroller and
Auditor-General</strong> relating to the accounts of the state, before
the state legislature.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="financial-powers">Financial Powers</h2>
<p>The financial powers and functions of the governor are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>He sees that the <strong>Annual Financial Statement</strong> (state
budget) is laid before the state legislature.</li>
<li><strong>Money bills</strong> can be introduced in the state
legislature only with his prior recommendation.</li>
<li>No <strong>demand for a grant</strong> can be made except on his
recommendation.</li>
<li>He can make advances out of the <strong>Contingency Fund</strong> of
the state to meet any unforeseen expenditure.</li>
<li>He constitutes a <strong>finance commission</strong> after every
five years to review the financial position of the panchayats and the
municipalities.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="judicial-powers">Judicial Powers</h2>
<p>The judicial powers and functions of the governor are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>He can <strong>grant pardons, reprieves, respites, and remissions of
punishment</strong> or suspend, remit, and commute the sentence of any
person convicted of any offence against any law relating to a matter to
which the executive power of the state extends.</li>
<li>He is consulted by the <strong>president</strong> while appointing
the judges of the concerned state high court.</li>
<li>He makes appointments, postings, and promotions of the
<strong>district judges</strong> in consultation with the state high
court.</li>
<li>He also appoints persons to the <strong>judicial service</strong> of
the state (other than district judges) in consultation with the state
high court and the <strong>State Public Service
Commission</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, we will study in detail the three important powers of the
governor (<strong>veto power</strong>, <strong>ordinance-making
power</strong>, and <strong>pardoning power</strong>) by comparing them
with that of the President.</p>
<h2 id="comparing-veto-powers-of-president-and-governor">Comparing Veto
Powers of President and Governor</h2>
<h3 id="president">President</h3>
<p><strong>With Regard to Ordinary Bills</strong></p>
<p>Every ordinary bill, after it is passed by both the Houses of the
Parliament either singly or at a joint sitting, is presented to the
President for his assent. He has three alternatives:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>He may <strong>give his assent</strong> to the bill, and the bill
then becomes an act.</li>
<li>He may <strong>withhold his assent</strong> to the bill, and the
bill then ends and does not become an act.</li>
<li>He may <strong>return the bill for reconsideration</strong> of the
Houses. If the bill is passed by both the Houses again with or without
amendments and presented to the President for his assent, the President
must give his assent to the bill. Thus, the President enjoys only a
<strong>‘suspensive veto’</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>When a state bill is reserved by the governor for the
consideration of the President, the President has three
alternatives:</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
<li>He may <strong>give his assent</strong> to the bill, and the bill
then becomes an act. (b) He may <strong>withhold his assent</strong> to
the bill, and the bill then ends and does not become an act. (c) He may
<strong>return the bill for reconsideration</strong> of the House or
Houses of the state legislature. When a bill is so returned, the House
or Houses have to reconsider it within six months. If the bill is passed
by the House or Houses again with or without amendments and presented to
the President for his assent, the President is not bound to give his
assent to the bill. He may give his assent to such a bill or withhold
his assent.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="governor-1">Governor</h3>
<p><strong>With Regard to Ordinary Bills</strong></p>
<p>Every ordinary bill, after it is passed by the legislative assembly
in the case of a unicameral legislature or by both the Houses in the
case of a bicameral legislature either in the first instance or in the
second instance, is presented to the governor for his assent. He has
four alternatives:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>He may <strong>give his assent</strong> to the bill, and the bill
then becomes an act.</li>
<li>He may <strong>withhold his assent</strong> to the bill, and the
bill then ends and does not become an act.</li>
<li>He may <strong>return the bill for reconsideration</strong> of the
House or Houses. If the bill is passed by the House or Houses again with
or without amendments and presented to the governor for his assent, the
governor must give his assent to the bill. Thus, the governor enjoys
only a <strong>‘suspensive veto’</strong>.</li>
<li>He may <strong>reserve the bill for the consideration of the
President</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>When the governor reserves a bill for the consideration of
the President, he will not have any further role in the enactment of the
bill. If the bill is returned by the President for the reconsideration
of the House or Houses and is passed again, the bill must be presented
again for the presidential assent only. If the President gives his
assent to the bill, it becomes an act. This means that the assent of the
Governor is no longer required.</strong></p>
<h2

Veto Powers of President and Governor with Regard to Money Bills</h2>
<h3 id="president-1">President</h3>
<p>Every money bill, after it is passed by the Parliament, is presented
to the President for his assent. He has two alternatives:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>He may <strong>give his assent</strong> to the bill, and the bill
then becomes an act.</li>
<li>He may <strong>withhold his assent</strong> to the bill, and the
bill then ends and does not become an act.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, the President cannot return a money bill for the
reconsideration of the Parliament. Normally, the President gives his
assent to a money bill as it is introduced in the Parliament with his
previous permission.</p>
<p>When a money bill is reserved by the Governor for the consideration
of the President, the President has two alternatives:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>He may <strong>give his assent</strong> to the bill, and the bill
then becomes an act. (b) He may <strong>withhold his assent</strong> to
the bill, and the bill then ends and does not become an act.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, the President cannot return a money bill for the
reconsideration of the state legislature (as in the case of the
Parliament).</p>
<h3 id="governor-2">Governor</h3>
<p>Every money bill, after it is passed by the state legislature
(unicameral or bicameral), is presented to the governor for his assent.
He has three alternatives:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>He may <strong>give his assent</strong> to the bill, and the bill
then becomes an act.</li>
<li>He may <strong>withhold his assent</strong> to the bill, and the

</ol>
<h2 id="constitutional-position-of-governor">CONSTITUTIONAL POSITION OF
GOVERNOR</h2>
<p>The <strong>Constitution of India</strong> provides for a
<strong>parliamentary form of government</strong> in the states as in
the Centre. Consequently, the governor has been made only a
<strong>nominal executive</strong>, with the real executive being the
<strong>council of ministers</strong> headed by the <strong>chief
minister</strong>. In other words, the governor has to exercise his
powers and functions with the aid and advice of the council of ministers
headed by the chief minister, except in matters in which he is required
to act in his <strong>discretion</strong> (i.e., without the advice of
ministers).</p>
<p>In estimating the constitutional position of the governor, particular
reference has to be made to the provisions of <strong>Articles 154, 163,
and 164</strong>. These are:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>The <strong>executive power of the state</strong> shall be vested in
the governor and shall be exercised by him either directly or through
officers subordinate to him in accordance with this Constitution
(<strong>Article 154</strong>). (b) There shall be a <strong>council of
ministers</strong> with the chief minister as the head to aid and advise
the governor in the exercise of his functions, except in so far as he is
required to exercise his functions in his discretion (<strong>Article
163</strong>). (c) The <strong>council of ministers</strong> shall be
collectively responsible to the <strong>legislative assembly</strong> of
the state (<strong>Article 164</strong>). This provision is the
foundation of the parliamentary system of government in the state.</li>
</ol>
<p>From the above, it is clear that the constitutional position of the
governor differs from that of the president in the following two
respects:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>While the Constitution envisages the possibility of the governor
acting at times in his discretion, no such possibility has been
envisaged for the President.</li>
<li>After the <strong>42nd Constitutional Amendment (1976)</strong>,
ministerial advice has been made binding on the President, but no such
provision has been made with respect to the governor.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Constitution makes it clear that if any question arises whether a
matter falls within the governor’s discretion or not, the decision of
the governor is final and the validity of anything done by him cannot be
called in question on the ground that he ought or ought not to have
acted in his discretion. The governor has <strong>constitutional
discretion</strong> in the following cases:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Reservation of a bill for the consideration of the
<strong>President</strong>.</li>
<li>Recommendation for the imposition of the <strong>President’s
Rule</strong> in the state.</li>
<li>While exercising his functions as the <strong>administrator of an
adjoining union territory</strong> (in case of additional charge).</li>
<li>Determining the amount payable by the Government of <strong>Assam,
Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram</strong> to an autonomous <strong>Tribal
District Council</strong> as royalty accruing from licenses for mineral
exploration.</li>
<li>Seeking information from the <strong>chief minister</strong> with
regard to the administrative and legislative matters of the state.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to the above <strong>constitutional discretion</strong>
(i.e., the express discretion mentioned in the Constitution), the
governor, like the president, also has <strong>situational
discretion</strong> (i.e., the hidden discretion derived from the
exigencies of a prevailing political situation) in the following
cases:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Appointment of chief minister</strong> when no party has a
clear-cut majority in the state legislative assembly or when the chief
minister in office dies suddenly and there is no obvious successor.</li>
<li><strong>Dismissal of the council of ministers</strong> when it
cannot prove the confidence of the state legislative assembly.</li>
<li><strong>Dissolution of the state legislative assembly</strong> if
the council of ministers has lost its majority.</li>
</ol>
<p>Moreover, the governor has certain <strong>special
responsibilities</strong> to discharge according to the directions
issued by the <strong>President</strong>. In this regard, the governor,
though has to consult the <strong>council of ministers</strong> led by
the <strong>chief minister</strong>, acts finally on his
<strong>discretion</strong>. They are as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Maharashtra</strong> – Establishment of separate development
boards for <strong>Vidarbha</strong> and
<strong>Marathwada</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Gujarat</strong> – Establishment of separate development
boards for <strong>Saurashtra</strong> and <strong>Kutch</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Nagaland</strong> – With respect to <strong>law and
order</strong> in the state for so long as the internal disturbance in
the <strong>Naga Hills-Tuensang Area</strong> continues.</li>
<li><strong>Assam</strong> – With respect to the administration of
<strong>tribal areas</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Manipur</strong> – Regarding the administration of the
<strong>hill areas</strong> in the state.</li>
<li><strong>Sikkim</strong> – For peace and for ensuring <strong>social
and economic advancement</strong> of the different sections of the
population.</li>
<li><strong>Arunachal Pradesh</strong> – With respect to <strong>law and
order</strong> in the state.</li>
<li><strong>Karnataka</strong> – Establishment of a separate development
board for <strong>Hyderabad-Karnataka</strong> region.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, the Constitution has assigned a <strong>dual role</strong> to
the office of a governor in the Indian federal system. He is the
<strong>constitutional head</strong> of the state as well as the
<strong>representative of the Centre</strong> (i.e., President).</p>
