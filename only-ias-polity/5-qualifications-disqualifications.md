Membership of the Parliament in India is governed by a set of qualifications and disqualifications outlined in both the Constitution and specific legislation, ensuring the integrity and eligibility of elected representatives. According to the Constitution, a person seeking membership in either the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha must be a citizen of India and must take and subscribe to an oath or affirmation as prescribed in Schedule-3. Additionally, the age requirements differ between the two houses, with candidates needing to be at least 25 years old to contest Lok Sabha elections and 30 years old for Rajya Sabha candidacy. Parliament has the authority to establish any other qualifications through legislation, supplementing the constitutional requirements.

The Representation of the People Act (RPA), 1951, further delineates eligibility criteria for parliamentary candidates. Prospective members must be registered as electors for a parliamentary constituency, ensuring their active participation in the electoral process. Moreover, individuals belonging to the Scheduled Castes (SC) or Scheduled Tribes (ST) community must meet specific criteria if contesting on a reserved seat, thereby safeguarding the representation of marginalized communities in Parliament.

Conversely, disqualifications for parliamentary membership are also explicitly stated in both the Constitution and the RPA, 1951. Constitutional disqualifications include holding an office of profit, lack of Indian citizenship, unsoundness of mind as declared by a court, being an undischarged insolvent, acquiring foreign citizenship, or having allegiance to a foreign state. Parliament may also enact laws to disqualify individuals based on additional grounds. The RPA, 1951, lists various offenses and actions that can lead to disqualification, such as election offenses or corrupt practices, failure to report election expenses, conflicts of interest in government contracts, promoting enmity, engaging in social crimes, corruption, or disloyalty to the state.

The President holds the final authority in determining whether a member is subject to any disqualifications, although obtaining the opinion of the Election Commission is customary. In cases of defection, as outlined in the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution, the chairperson of the respective house, namely the chairman in the Rajya Sabha and the speaker in the Lok Sabha, adjudicate on matters of party defection. However, their decisions are subject to judicial review, as established in the Kihoto Hollohan Judgment.

In essence, the qualifications and disqualifications for parliamentary membership in India are designed to uphold the integrity, competence, and allegiance of elected representatives, ensuring that they serve the best interests of the nation and its citizens. These provisions aim to maintain the democratic principles of accountability, transparency, and ethical conduct within the parliamentary framework.
