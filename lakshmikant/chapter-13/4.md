### Critical Evaluation of India's Federal System

1. **Diverse Perspectives on Federalism**:
    
    - **KC Wheare**: "Quasi-federal"; unitary state with subsidiary federal features.
    - **K Santhanam**: Unitary bias due to financial centralization and Planning Commission influence.
    - **Paul Appleby**: "Extremely federal."
    - **Morris Jones**: "Bargaining federalism."
    - **Ivor Jennings**: Federation with centralizing tendencies.
    - **Alexandrowicz**: Unique federal character.
    - **Granville Austin**: "Cooperative federalism"; strong Centre but states retain independence.
2. **Ambedkar's View**:
    
    - Constitution establishes a dual polity.
    - Union and states derive authority from the Constitution, not from each other.
    - Flexible structure allows for unitary or federal response based on context.
3. **Supreme Court on Federalism (Bommai Case, 1994)**:
    
    - Constitution is inherently federal.
    - Centre's overriding powers during emergencies don't undermine federalism.
    - Federalism is a foundational principle.
4. **Balance of Powers**:
    
    - **Federal Structure**: States have autonomy within their spheres.
    - **National Unity**: Strong Centre required in exceptional situations.
5. **Federal Spirit in Practice**:
    
    - Territorial disputes between states (e.g., Maharashtra vs Karnataka).
    - River water disputes (e.g., Karnataka vs Tamil Nadu over Cauvery).
    - Regional parties asserting influence and gaining power in states.
    - Creation of new states reflecting regional aspirations (e.g., Jharkhand).
    - States seeking increased financial grants from the Centre.
    - Assertion of state autonomy and resistance to Centre's interference.
    - Supreme Court limiting misuse of Article 356 (President's Rule).
