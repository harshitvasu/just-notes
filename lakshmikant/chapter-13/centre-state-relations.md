# ADMINISTRATIVE RELATIONS
Articles 256 to 263 in Part XI of the Constitution deal with the
administrative relations between the Centre and the states. In
addition, there are various other articles pertaining to the same matter.
Distribution of Executive Powers
The executive power has been divided between the Centre and the
states on the lines of the distribution of legislative powers, except in
few cases. Thus, the executive power of the Centre extends to the
whole of India: (i) to the matters on which the Parliament has
exclusive power of legislation (i.e., the subjects enumerated in the
Union List); and (ii) to the exercise of rights, authority and jurisdiction
conferred on it by any treaty or agreement. Similarly, the executive
power of a state extends to its territory in respect of matters on which
the state legislature has exclusive power of legislation (i.e., the
subjects enumerated in the State List).
In respect of matters on which both the Parliament and the state
legislatures have power of legislation (i.e., the subjects enumerated in
the Concurrent List), the executive power rests with the states except
when a Constitutional provision or a parliamentary law specifically
confers it on the Centre. Therefore, a law on a concurrent subject,
though enacted by the Parliament, is to be executed by the states
except when the Constitution or the Parliament has directed
otherwise.5


Obligation of States and the Centre
The Constitution has placed two restrictions on the executive power of
the states in order to give ample scope to the Centre for exercising its
executive power in an unrestricted manner. Thus, the executive power
of every state is to be exercised in such a way (a) as to ensure
compliance with the laws made by the Parliament and any existing law
which apply in the state; and (b) as not to impede or prejudice the
exercise of executive power of the Centre in the state. While the
former lays down a general obligation upon the state, the latter
imposes a specific obligation on the state not to hamper the executive
power of the Centre.
In both the cases, the executive power of the Centre extends to
giving of such directions to the state as are necessary for the purpose.
The sanction behind these directions of the Centre is coercive in
nature. Thus, Article 365 says that where any state has failed to
comply with (or to give effect to) any directions given by the Centre, it
will be lawful for the President to hold that a situation has arisen in
which the government of the state cannot be carried on in accordance
with the provisions of the Constitution. It means that, in such a
situation, the President’s rule can be imposed in the state under
Article 356.
Centre’s Directions to the States
In addition to the above two cases, the Centre is empowered to give
directions to the states with regard to the exercise of their executive
power in the following matters:
(i) the construction and maintenance of means of communication
(declared to be of national or military importance) by the state;
(ii) the measures to be taken for the protection of the railways within
the state;
(iii) the provision of adequate facilities for instruction in the mothertongue
at the primary stage of education to children belonging to
linguistic minority groups in the state; and
(iv) the drawing up and execution of the specified schemes for the
welfare of the Scheduled Tribes in the state.
The coercive sanction behind the Central directions under Article
365 (mentioned above) is also applicable in these cases.


Mutual Delegation of Functions
The distribution of legislative powers between the Centre and the
states is rigid. Consequently, the Centre cannot delegate its legislative
powers to the states and a single state cannot request the Parliament
to make a law on a state subject. The distribution of executive power
in general follows the distribution of legislative powers. But, such a
rigid division in the executive sphere may lead to occasional conflicts
between the two. Hence, the Constitution provides for intergovernment
delegation of executive functions in order to mitigate
rigidity and avoid a situation of deadlock.
Accordingly, the President may, with the consent of the state
government, entrust to that government any of the executive functions
of the Centre. Conversely, the governor of a state may, with the
consent of the Central government, entrust to that government any of
the executive functions of the state.6 This mutual delegation of
administrative functions may be conditional or unconditional.
The Constitution also makes a provision for the entrustment of the
executive functions of the Centre to a state without the consent of that
state. But, in this case, the delegation is by the Parliament and not by
the president. Thus, a law made by the Parliament on a subject of the
Union List can confer powers and impose duties on a state, or
authorise the conferring of powers and imposition of duties by the
Centre upon a state (irrespective of the consent of the state
concerned). Notably, the same thing cannot be done by the state
legislature.
From the above, it is clear that the mutual delegation of functions
between the Centre and the state can take place either under an
agreement or by a legislation. While the Centre can use both the
methods, a state can use only the first method.
Cooperation Between the Centre and States
The Constitution contains the following provisions to secure
cooperation and coordination between the Centre and the states:
(i) The Parliament can provide for the adjudication of any dispute or
complaint with respect to the use, distribution and control of
waters of any inter-state river and river valley.
(ii) The President can establish (under Article 263) an Inter-State
Council to investigate and discuss subject of common interest
between the Centre and the states. Such a council was set up in
1990.7
(iii) Full faith and credit is to be given throughout the territory of India
to public acts, records and judicial proceedings of the Centre and
every state.
(iv) The Parliament can appoint an appropriate authority to carry out
the purposes of the constitutional provisions relating to the
interstate freedom of trade, commerce and intercourse. But, no
such authority has been appointed so far.



All-India Services
Like in any other federation, the Centre and the states also have their
separate public services called as the Central Services and the State
Services respectively. In addition, there are all-India services–IAS, IPS
and IFS. The members of these services occupy top positions (or key
posts) under both the Centre and the states and serve them by turns.
But, they are recruited and trained by the Centre.
These services are controlled jointly by the Centre and the states.
The ultimate control lies with the Central government while the
immediate control vests with the state governments.
In 1947, Indian Civil Service (ICS) was replaced by IAS and the
Indian Police (IP) was replaced by IPS and were recognised by the
Constitution as All-India Services. In 1966, the Indian Forest Service
(IFS) was created as the third All-India Service. Article 312 of the
Constitution authorises the Parliament to create new All-India Services
on the basis of a Rajya Sabha resolution to that effect.
Each of these three all-India services, irrespective of their division
among different states, form a single service with common rights and
status and uniform scales of pay throughout the country.
Though the all-India services violate the principle of federalism
under the Constitution by restricting the autonomy and patronage of
the states, they are supported on the ground that (i) they help in
maintaining high standard of administration in the Centre as well as in
the states; (ii) they help to ensure uniformity of the administrative
system throughout the country; and (iii) they facilitate liaison,
cooperation, coordination and joint action on the issues of common
interest between the Centre and the states.
While justifying the institution of all-India services in the Constituent
Assembly, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar observed that: “The dual polity which is
inherent in a federal system is followed in all federations by a dual
service. In all federations, there is a Federal Civil Service and a State
Civil Service. The Indian federation, though a dual polity, will have a
dual service, but with one exception. It is recognised that in every
country there are certain posts in its administrative set up which might
be called strategic from the point of view of maintaining the standard
of administration. There can be no doubt that the standard of
administration depends upon the calibre of the civil servants who are
appointed to the strategic posts. The Constitution provides that without
depriving the states of their rights to form their own civil services, there
shall be an all-India service, recruited on an allIndia basis with
common qualifications, with uniform scale of pay and members of
which alone could be appointed to those strategic posts throughout
the Union”.8


Public Service Commissions
In the field of public service commissions, the Centre-state relations
are as follows:
(i) The Chairman and members of a state public service
commission, though appointed by the governor of the state, can
be removed only by the President.
(ii) The Parliament can establish a Joint State Public Service
Commission (JSPSC) for two or more states on the request of the
state legislatures concerned. The chairman and members of the
JSPSC are appointed by the president.
(iii) The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) can serve the
needs of a state on the request of the state governor and with the
approval of the President.
(iv) The UPSC assists the states (when requested by two or more
states) in framing and operating schemes of joint recruitment for
any services for which candidates possessing special
qualifications are required.


Integrated Judicial System
Though India has a dual polity, there is no dual system of
administration of justice. The Constitution, on the other hand,
established an integrated judicial system with the Supreme Court at
the top and the state high courts below it. This single system of courts
enforces both the Central laws as well as the state laws. This is done
to eliminate diversities in the remedial procedure.
The judges of a state high court are appointed by the president in
consultation with the Chief Justice of India and the governor of the
state. They can also be transferred and removed by the president.
The Parliament can establish a common high court for two or more
states. For example, Maharashtra and Goa or Punjab and Haryana
have a common high court.

Relations During Emergencies
(i) During the operation of a national emergency (under Article 352),
the Centre becomes entitled to give executive directions to a state
on ‘any’ matter. Thus, the state governments are brought under
the complete control of the Centre, though they are not
suspended.
(ii) When the President’s Rule is imposed in a state (under Article
356), the President can assume to himself the functions of the
state government and powers vested in the Governor or any other
executive authority in the state.
(iii) During the operation of a financial emergency (under Article 360),
the Centre can direct the states to observe canons of financial
propriety and can give other necessary directions including the
reduction of salaries of persons serving in the state.

Other Provisions
The Constitution contains the following other provisions which enable
the Centre to exercise control over the state administration:
(i) Article 355 imposes two duties on the Centre: (a) to protect every
state against external aggression and internal disturbance; and
(b) to ensure that the government of every state is carried on in
accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.
(ii) The governor of a state is appointed by the president. He holds
office during the pleasure of the President. In addition to the
Constitutional head of the state, the governor acts as an agent of
the Centre in the state. He submits periodical reports to the
Centre about the administrative affairs of the state.
(iii) The state election commissioner, though appointed by the
governor of the state, can be removed only by the President.



Extra-Constitutional Devices
In addition to the above-mentioned constitutional devices, there are
extra-constitutional devices to promote cooperation and coordination
between the Centre and the states. These include a number of
advisory bodies and conferences held at the Central level.
The non-constitutional advisory bodies include the NITI Ayog
(which succeeded the planning commission),9 the National Integration
Council,10 the Central Council of Health and Family Welfare, the
Central Council of Local Government, the Zonal Councils,11 the North-
Eastern Council, the Central Council of Indian Medicine, the Central
Council of Homoeopathy, the Transport Development Council, the
University Grants Commission and so on.
The important conferences held either annually or otherwise to
facilitate Centrestate consultation on a wide range of matters are as
follows: (i) The governors’ conference (presided over by the
President). (ii) The chief ministers’ conference (presided over by the
prime minister). (iii) The chief secretaries’ conference (presided over
by the cabinet secretary). (iv) The conference of inspector-general of
police. (v) The chief justices’ conference (presided over by the chief
justice of India). (vi) The conference of vice-chancellors. (vii) The
home ministers’ conference (presided over by the Central home
minister). (viii) The law ministers’ conference (presided over by the
Central law minister).



# FINANCIAL RELATIONS
Articles 268 to 293 in Part XII of the Constitution deal with Centrestate
financial relations. Besides these, there are other provisions
dealing with the same subject. These together can be studied under
the following heads:

Allocation of Taxing Powers
The Constitution divides the taxing powers between the Centre and
the states in the following way:
• The Parliament has exclusive power to levy taxes on subjects
enumerated in the Union List (which are 13 in number12 ).
• The state legislature has exclusive power to levy taxes on
subjects enumerated in the State List (which are 18 in number13
).
• There are no tax entries in the Concurrent List. In other words,
the concurrent jurisdiction is not available with respect to tax
legislation. But, the 101st Amendment Act of 2016 has made an
exception by making a special provision with respect to goods
and services tax. This Amendment has conferred concurrent
power upon Parliament and State Legislatures to make laws
governing goods and services tax14 .
• The residuary power of taxation (that is, the power to impose
taxes not enumerated in any of the three lists) is vested in the
Parliament. Under this provision, the Parliament has imposed gift
tax, wealth tax and expenditure tax.


The Constitution also draws a distinction between the power to levy
and collect a tax and the power to appropriate the proceeds of the tax
so levied and collected. For example, the income-tax is levied and
collected by the Centre but its proceeds are distributed between the
Centre and the states.
Further, the Constitution has placed the following restrictions on the
taxing powers of the states:
(i) A state legislature can impose taxes on professions, trades,
callings and employments. But, the total amount of such taxes
payable by any person should not exceed ₹2,500 per annum.15
(ii) A state legislature is prohibited from imposing a tax on the supply
of goods or services or both in the following two cases : (a) where
such supply takes place outside the state; and (b) where such
supply takes place in the course of import or export. Further, the
Parliament is empowered to formulate the principles for
determining when a supply of goods or services or both takes
place outside the state, or in the course of import or export16 .
(iii) A state legislature can impose tax on the consumption or sale of
electricity. But, no tax can be imposed on the consumption or sale
of electricity which is (a) consumed by the Centre or sold to the
Centre; or (b) consumed in the construction, maintenance or
operation of any railway by the Centre or by the concerned
railway company or sold to the Centre or the railway company for
the same purpose.
(iv) A state legislature can impose a tax in respect of any water or
electricity stored, generated, consumed, distributed or sold by any
authority established by Parliament for regulating or developing
any inter-state river or river valley. But, such a law, to be effective,
should be reserved for the president’s consideration and receive
his assent.

Distribution of Tax Revenues
The 80th Amendment Act of 2000 and the 101st Amendment Act of
2016 have introduced major changes in the scheme of the distribution
of tax revenues between the centre and the states.
The 80th Amendment was enacted to give effect to the
recommendations of the 10th Finance Commission. The Commission
recommended that out of the total income obtained from certain
central taxes and duties, 29% should go to the states. This is known
as the ‘Alternative Scheme of Devolution’ and came into effect
retrospectively from April 1, 1996. This amendment has brought
several central taxes and duties like Corporation Tax and Customs
Duties at par with Income Tax (taxes on income other than agricultural
income) as far as their constitutionally mandated sharing with the
states is concerned.17
The 101st Amendment has paved the way for the introduction of a
new tax regime (i.e., goods and services tax - GST) in the country.
Accordingly, the Amendment conferred concurrent taxing powers upon
the Parliament and the State Legislatures to make laws for levying
GST on every transaction of supply of goods or services or both. The
GST replaced a number of indirect taxes levied by the Union and the
State Governments and is intended to remove cascading effect of
taxes and provide for a common national market for goods and
services. The Amendment provided for subsuming of various central
indirect taxes and levies such as (i) Central Excise Duty, (ii) Additional
Excise Duties, (iii) Excise Duty levied under the Medicinal and Toilet
Preparations (Excise Duties) Act, 1955, (iv) Service Tax, (v) Additional
Customs Duty commonly known as Countervailing Duty, (vi) Special
Additional Duty of Customs, and (vii) Central Surcharges and Cesses
so far as they related to the supply of goods and services. Similarly,
the Amendment provided for subsuming of (i) State Value Added Tax /
Sales Tax, (ii) Entertainment Tax (other than the tax levied by the local
bodies), (iii) Central Sales Tax (levied by the Centre and collected by
the States), (iv) Octroi and Entry Tax, (v) Purchase Tax, (vi) Luxury
Tax, (vii) Taxes on lottery, betting and gambling, and (viii) State
Surcharges and Cesses in so far as they related to the supply of
goods and services. Further, the Amendment deleted Article 268-A as
well as Entry 92-C in the Union List, both were dealing with service
tax. They were added earlier by the 88th Amendment Act of 2003. The
service tax was levied by the Centre but collected and appropriated by
both the Centre and the States.
After the above two amendments (i.e., 80th Amendment and 101st
Amendment), the present position with respect to the distribution of
tax revenues between the centre and the states is as follows:
A. Taxes Levied by the Centre but Collected and Appropriated by
the States (Article 268): This category includes the stamp duties on
bills of exchange, cheques, promissory notes, policies of insurance,
transfer of shares and others.
The proceeds of these duties levied within any state do not form a
part of the Consolidated Fund of India, but are assigned to that state.
B. Taxes Levied and Collected by the Centre but Assigned to the
States (Article 269): The following taxes fall under this category:
(i) Taxes on the sale or purchase of goods (other than newspapers)
in the course of inter-state trade or commerce.
(ii) Taxes on the consignment of goods in the course of inter-state
trade or commerce.
The net proceeds of these taxes do not form a part of the
Consolidated Fund of India. They are assigned to the concerned
states in accordance with the principles laid down by the Parliament.
C. Levy and Collection of Goods and Services Tax in Course of
Inter-State Trade or Commerce (Article 269-A): The Goods and
Services Tax (GST) on supplies in the course of inter-state trade or
commerce are levied and collected by the Centre. But, this tax is
divided between the Centre and the States in the manner provided by
Parliament on the recommendations of the GST Council. Further, the
Parliament is also authorized to formulate the principles for
determining the place of supply, and when a supply of goods or
services or both takes place in the course of inter-state trade or
commerce.
D. Taxes Levied and Collected by the Centre but Distributed
between the Centre and the States (Article 270): This category
includes all taxes and duties referred to in the Union List except the
following:
(i) Duties and taxes referred to in Articles 268, 269 and 269-A
(mentioned above);
(ii) Surcharge on taxes and duties referred to in Article 271
(mentioned below); and
(iii) Any cess levied for specific purposes.
The manner of distribution of the net proceeds of these taxes and
duties is prescribed by the President on the recommendation of the
Finance Commission.
E. Surcharge on Certain Taxes and Duties for Purposes of the
Centre (Article 271): The Parliament can at any time levy the
surcharges on taxes and duties referred to in Articles 269 and 270
(mentioned above). The proceeds of such surcharges go to the Centre
exclusively. In other words, the states have no share in these
surcharges.
However, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) is exempted from this
surcharge. In other words, this surcharge can not be imposed on the
GST.
F. Taxes Levied and Collected and Retained by the States: These
are the taxes belonging to the states exclusively. They are
enumerated in the state list and are 18 in number. These are18 : (i)
land revenue; (ii) taxes on agricultural income; (iii) duties in respect of
succession to agricultural land; (iv) estate duty in respect of
agricultural land; (v) taxes on lands and buildings; (vi) taxes on
mineral rights; (vii) Duties of excise on alcoholic liquors for human
consumption; opium, Indian hemp and other narcotic drugs and
narcotics, but not including medicinal and toilet preparations
containing alcohol or narcotics; (viii) taxes on the consumption or sale
or electricity; (ix) taxes on the sale of petroleum crude, high speed
diesel, motor spirit (commonly known as petrol), natural gas, aviation
turbine fuel and alcoholic liquor for human consumption, but not
including sale in the course of inter-state trade or commerce or sale in
the course of international trade or commerce of such goods; (x) taxes
on goods and passengers carried by road or inland waterways; (xi)
taxes on vehicles; (xii) taxes on animals and boats; (xiii) tolls; (xiv)
taxes on professions, trades, callings and employments; (xv)
capitation taxes; (xvi) taxes on entertainments and amusements to the
extent levied and collected by a Panchayat or a Municipality or a
Regional Council or a District Council; (xvii) stamp duty on documents
(except those specified in the Union List); and (xviii) fees on the
matters enumerated in the State List (except court fees).

Distribution of Non-tax Revenues
A. The Centre
The receipts from the following form the major sources of non-tax
revenues of the Centre: (i) posts and telegraphs; (ii) railways; (iii)
banking; (iv) broadcasting (v) coinage and currency; (vi) central public
sector enterprises; (vii) escheat and lapse;19 and (viii) others.
B. The States
The receipts from the following form the major sources of non-tax
revenues of the states: (i) irrigation; (ii) forests; (iii) fisheries; (iv) state
public sector enterprises; (v) escheat and lapse;20 and (vi) others.
Grants-in-Aid to the States
Besides sharing of taxes between the Centre and the states, the
Constitution provides for grants-in-aid to the states from the Central
resources. There are two types of grants-in-aid, viz, statutory grants
and discretionary grants:

Statutory Grants
Article 275 empowers the Parliament to make grants to the states
which are in need of financial assistance and not to every state. Also,
different sums may be fixed for different states. These sums are
charged on the Consolidated Fund of India every year.
Apart from this general provision, the Constitution also provides for
specific grants for promoting the welfare of the scheduled tribes in a
state or for raising the level of administration of the scheduled areas in
a state including the State of Assam.
The statutory grants under Article 275 (both general and specific)
are given to the states on the recommendation of the Finance
Commission.

Discretionary Grants
Article 282 empowers both the Centre and the states to make any
grants for any public purpose, even if it is not within their respective
legislative competence. Under this provision, the Centre makes grants
to the states.
“These grants are also known as discretionary grants, the reason
being that the Centre is under no obligation to give these grants and
the matter lies within its discretion. These grants have a two-fold
purpose: to help the state financially to fulfil plan targets; and to give
some leverage to the Centre to influence and coordinate state action
to effectuate the national plan.”21
Other Grants
The Constitution also provided for a third type of grants-in-aid, but for
a temporary period. Thus, a provision was made for grants in lieu of
export duties on jute and jute products to the States of Assam, Bihar,
Orissa and West Bengal. These grants were to be given for a period
of ten years from the commencement of the Constitution. These sums
were charged on the Consolidated Fund of India and were made to
the states on the recommendation of the Finance Commission.

Goods and Services Tax Council
The smooth and efficient administration of the goods and services tax
(GST) requires a co-operation and co-ordination between the Centre
and the States. In order to facilitate this consultation process, the
101st Amendment Act of 2016 provided for the establishment of a
Goods and Services Tax Council or the GST Council.
Article 279-A empowered the President to constitute a GST Council
by an order22. The Council is a joint forum of the Centre and the
States. It is required to make recommendations to the Centre and the
States on the following matters:
(a) The taxes, cesses and surcharges levied by the Centre, the
States and the local bodies that would get merged in GST.
(b) The goods and services that may be subjected to GST or
exempted from GST.
(c) Model GST Laws, principles of levy, apportionment of GST levied
on supplies in the course of inter-state trade or commerce and
the principles that govern the place of supply.
(d) The threshold limit of turnover below which goods and services
may be exempted from GST.
(e) The rates including floor rates with bands of GST.
(f) Any special rate or rates for a specified period to raise additional
resources during any natural calamity or disaster.

Finance Commission
Article 280 provides for a Finance Commission as a quasi-judicial
body. It is constituted by the President every fifth year or even earlier.
It is required to make recommendations to the President on the
following matters:
• The distribution of the net proceeds of taxes to be shared
between the Centre and the states, and the allocation between
the states, the respective shares of such proceeds.
• The principles which should govern the grants-in-aid to the states
by the Centre (i.e., out of the Consolidated Fund of India).
• The measures needed to augment the Consolidated fund of a
state to supplement the resources of the panchayats and the
municipalities in the state on the basis of the recommendations
made by the State Finance Commission.23
• Any other matter referred to it by the President in the interests of
sound finance.
Till 1960, the Commission also suggested the amounts paid to the
States of Assam, Bihar, Orissa and West Bengal in lieu of assignment
of any share of the net proceeds in each year of export duty on jute
and jute products.
The Constitution envisages the Finance Commission as the
balancing wheel of fiscal federalism in India.

Protection of the States’ Interest
To protect the interest of states in the financial matters, the
Constitution lays down that the following bills can be introduced in the
Parliament only on the recommendation of the President:
• A bill which imposes or varies any tax or duty in which states are
interested;
• A bill which varies the meaning of the expression ‘agricultural
income’ as defined for the purposes of the enactments relating to
Indian income tax;
• A bill which affects the principles on which moneys are or may be
distributable to states; and
• A bill which imposes any surcharge on any specified tax or duty
for the purpose of the Centre.
The expression “tax or duty in which states are interested” means:
(a) a tax or duty the whole or part of the net proceeds whereof are
assigned to any state; or (b) a tax or duty by reference to the net
proceeds whereof sums are for the time being payable, out of the
Consolidated Fund of India to any state.
The phrase ‘net proceeds’ means the proceeds of a tax or a duty
minus the cost of collection. The net proceeds of a tax or a duty in any
area is to be ascertained and certified by the Comptroller and Auditor-
General of India. His certificate is final.
Borrowing by the Centre and the States
The Constitution makes the following provisions with regard to the
borrowing powers of the Centre and the states:
• The Central government can borrow either within India or outside
upon the security of the Consolidated Fund of India or can give
guarantees, but both within the limits fixed by the Parliament. So
far, no such law has been enacted by the Parliament.
• Similarly, a state government can borrow within India (and not
abroad) upon the security of the Consolidated Fund of the State
or can give guarantees, but both within the limits fixed by the
legislature of that state.
• The Central government can make loans to any state or give
guarantees in respect of loans raised by any state. Any sums
required for the purpose of making such loans are to be charged
on the Consolidated Fund of India.
• A state cannot raise any loan without the consent of the Centre, if
there is still outstanding any part of a loan made to the state by
the Centre or in respect of which a guarantee has been given by
the Centre.


Inter-Governmental Tax Immunities
Like any other federal Constitution, the Indian Constitution also
contain the rule of ‘immunity from mutual taxation’ and makes the
following provisions in this regard:
Exemption of Central Property from State Taxation
The property of Centre is exempted from all taxes imposed by a state
or any authority within a state like municipalities, district boards,
panchayats and so on. But, the Parliament is empowered to remove
this ban. The word ‘property’ includes lands, buildings, chattels,
shares, debts, everything that has a money value, and every kind of
property–movable or immovable and tangible or intangible. Further,
the property may be used for sovereign (like armed forces) or
commercial purposes.
The corporations or the companies created by the Central
government are not immune from state taxation or local taxation. The
reason is that a corporation or a company is a separate legal entity.
Exemption of State Property or Income from Central Taxation
The property and income of a state is exempted from Central taxation.
Such income may be derived from sovereign functions or commercial
functions. But the Centre can tax the commercial operations of a state
if Parliament so provides. However, the Parliament can declare any
particular trade or business as incidental to the ordinary functions of
the government and it would then not be taxable.
Notably, the property and income of local authorities situated within
a state are not exempted from the Central taxation. Similarly, the
property or income of corporations and companies owned by a state
can be taxed by the Centre.
The Supreme Court, in an advisory opinion24 (1963), held that the
immunity granted to a state in respect of Central taxation does not
extend to the duties of customs or duties of excise. In other words, the
Centre can impose customs duty on goods imported or exported by a
state, or an excise duty on goods produced or manufactured by a
state.


Effects of Emergencies
The Centre-state financial relations in normal times (described above)
undergo changes during emergencies. These are as follows:

National Emergency
While the proclamation of national emergency (under Article 352) is in
operation, the president can modify the constitutional distribution of
revenues between the Centre and the states. This means that the
president can either reduce or cancel the transfer of finances (both tax
sharing and grants-in-aid) from the Centre to the states. Such
modification continues till the end of the financial year in which the
emergency ceases to operate.

Financial Emergency

While the proclamation of financial emergency (under Article 360) is in
operation, the Centre can give directions to the states: (i) to observe
the specified canons of financial propriety; (ii) to reduce the salaries
and allowances of all class of persons serving in the state; and (iii) to
reserve all money bills and other financial bills for the consideration of
the President.


## TRENDS IN CENTRE-STATE RELATIONS
Till 1967, the centre-state relations by and large were smooth due to
one-party rule at the Centre and in most of the states. In 1967
elections, the Congress party was defeated in nine states and its
position at the Centre became weak. This changed political scenario
heralded a new era in the Centre-state relations. The non-Congress
Governments in the states opposed the increasing centralisation and
intervention of the Central government. They raised the issue of state
autonomy and demanded more powers and financial resources to the
states. This caused tensions and conflicts in Centre-state relations.
Tension Areas in Centre-State Relations
The issues which created tensions and conflicts between the Centre
and states are: (1) Mode of appointment and dismissal of governor;
(2) Discriminatory and partisan role of governors; (3) Imposition of
President’s Rule for partisan interests; (4) Deployment of Central
forces in the states to maintain law and order; (5) Reservation of state
bills for the consideration of the President; (6) Discrimination in
financial allocations to the states; (7) Role of Planning Commission in
approving state projects; (8) Management of All-India Services (IAS,
IPS, and IFS); (9) Use of electronic media for political purposes; (10)
Appointment of enquiry commissions against the chief ministers; (11)
Sharing of finances (between Centre and states); and (12)
Encroachment by the Centre on the State List.
The issues in Centre-State relations have been under consideration
since the mid 1960s. In this direction, the following developments
have taken place:

## Administrative Reforms Commission
The Central government appointed a six-member Administrative
Reforms Commission (ARC) in 1966 under the chairmanship of
Morarji Desai (followed by K Hanumanthayya). Its terms of references
included, among others, the examination of Centre-State relations. In
order to examine thoroughly the various issues in Centre-state
relations, the ARC constituted a study team under M.C. Setalvad. On
the basis of the report of this study team, the ARC finalised its own
report and submitted it to the Central government in 1969. It made 22
recommendations for improving the Centre-state relations. The
important recommendations are:
• Establishment of an Inter-State Council under Article 263 of the
Constitution.
• Appointment of persons having long experience in public life and
administration and non-partisan attitude as governors.
• Delegation of powers to the maximum extent to the states.
• Transferring of more financial resources to the states to reduce
their dependency upon the Centre.
• Deployment of Central armed forces in the states either on their
request or otherwise.
No action was taken by the Central government on the
recommendations of the ARC.

## Rajamannar Committee

In 1969, the Tamil Nadu Government (DMK) appointed a threemember
committee under the chairmanship of Dr. P.V. Rajamannar to
examine the entire question of Centre-state relations and to suggest
amendments to the Constitution so as to secure utmost autonomy to
the states.25 The committee submitted its report to the Tamil Nadu
Government in 1971.
The Committee identified the reasons for the prevailing unitary
trends (tendencies of centralisation) in the country. They include: (i)
certain provisions in the Constitution which confer special powers on
the Centre; (ii) one-party rule both at the Centre and in the states; (iii)
inadequacy of states’ fiscal resources and consequent dependence
on the Centre for financial assistance; and (iv) the institution of Central
planning and the role of the Planning Commission.
The important recommendations of the committee are as follows: (i)
An Inter-State Council should be set up immediately; (ii) Finance
Commission should be made a permanent body; (iii) Planning
Commission should be disbanded and its place should be taken by a
statutory body; (iv) Articles 356, 357 and 365 (dealing with President’s
Rule) should be totally omitted; (v) The provision that the state
ministry holds office during the pleasure of the governor should be
omitted; (vi) Certain subjects of the Union List and the Concurrent List
should be transferred to the State List; (vii) the residuary powers
should be allocated to the states; and (viii) All-India services (IAS, IPS
and IFS) should be abolished.
The Central government completely ignored the recommendations
of the Rajamannar Committee.

## Anandpur Sahib Resolution
In 1973, the Akali Dal adopted a resolution containing both political
and religious demands in a meeting held at Anandpur Sahib in
Punjab. The resolution, generally known as Anandpur Sahib
Resolution, demanded that the Centre’s jurisdiction should be
restricted only to defence, foreign affairs, communications, and
currency and the entire residuary powers should be vested in the
states. It stated that the Constitution should be made federal in the
real sense and should ensure equal authority and representation to all
the states at the Centre.
West Bengal Memorandum
In 1977, the West Bengal Government (led by the Communists)
published a memorandum on Centre-state relations and sent to the
Central government. The memorandum inter alia suggested the
following: (i) The word ‘union’ in the Constitution should be replaced
by the word ‘federal’; (ii) The jurisdiction of the Centre should be
confined to defence, foreign affairs, currency, communications and
economic co-ordination; (iii) All other subjects including the residuary
should be vested in the states; (iv) Articles 356 and 357 (President’s
Rule) and 360 (financial emergency) should be repealed; (v) State’s
consent should be made obligatory for formation of new states or
reorganisation of existing states; (vi) Of the total revenue raised by the
Centre from all sources, 75 per cent should be allocated to the states;
(vii) Rajya Sabha should have equal powers with that of the Lok
Sabha; and (viii) There should be only Central and state services and
the allIndia services should be abolished.
The Central government did not accept the demands made in the
memorandum.

## Sarkaria Commission
In 1983, the Central government appointed a three-member
Commission on Centrestate relations under the chairmanship of R.S.
Sarkaria, a retired judge of the Supreme Court.26 The commission
was asked to examine and review the working of existing
arrangements between the Centre and states in all spheres and
recommend appropriate changes and measures. It was initially given
one year to complete its work, but its term was extended four times. It
submitted it’s report in 1988.
The Commission did not favour structural changes and regarded
the existing constitutional arrangements and principles relating to the
institutions basically sound. But, it emphasised on the need for
changes in the functional or operational aspects. It observed that
federalism is more a functional arrangement for co-operative action
than a static institutional concept. It outrightly rejected the demand for
curtailing the powers of the Centre and stated that a strong Centre is
essential to safeguard the national unity and integrity which is being
threatened by the fissiparious tendencies in the body politic. However,
it did not equate strong Centre with centralisation of powers. It
observed that over-centralisation leads to blood pressure at the centre
and anaemia at the periphery.
The Commission made 247 recommendations to improve Centrestate
relations. The important recommendations are mentioned below:
1. A permanent Inter-State Council called the Inter-Governmental
Council should be set up under Article 263.
2. Article 356 (President’s Rule) should be used very sparingly, in
extreme cases as a last resort when all the available alternatives
fail.
3. The institution of All-India Services should be further
strengthened and some more such services should be created.
4. The residuary powers of taxation should continue to remain with
the Parliament, while the other residuary powers should be
placed in the Concurrent List.
5. When the president withholds his assent to the state bills, the
reasons should be communicated to the state government.
6. The National Development Council (NDC) should be renamed
and reconstituted as the National Economic and Development
Council (NEDC).
7. The zonal councils should be constituted afresh and reactivated
to promote the spirit of federalism.
8. The Centre should have powers to deploy its armed forces, even
without the consent of states. However, it is desirable that the
states should be consulted.
9. The Centre should consult the states before making a law on a
subject of the Concurrent List.
10. The procedure of consulting the chief minister in the
appointment of the state governor should be prescribed in the
Constitution itself.
11. The net proceeds of the corporation tax may be made
permissibly shareable with the states.
12. The governor cannot dismiss the council of ministers so long as
it commands a majority in the assembly.
13. The governor’s term of five years in a state should not be
disturbed except for some extremely compelling reasons.
14. No commission of enquiry should be set up against a state
minister unless a demand is made by the Parliament.
15. The surcharge on income tax should not be levied by the Centre
except for a specific purpose and for a strictly limited period.
16. The present division of functions between the Finance
Commission and the Planning Commission is reasonable and
should continue.
17. Steps should be taken to uniformly implement the three
language formula in its true spirit.
18. No autonomy for radio and television but decentralisation in their
operations.
19. No change in the role of Rajya Sabha and Centre’s power to
reorganise the states.
20. The commissioner for linguistic minorities should be activated.
The Central government has implemented 180 (out of 247)
recommendations of the Sarkaria Commission. The most important is
the establishment of the Inter-State Council in 1990.

## Punchhi Commission
The Second commission on Centre-State Relations was set-up by the
Government of India in April 2007 under the Chairmanship of Madan
Mohan Punchhi, former Chief Justice of India.27 It was required to look
into the issues of Centre-State relations keeping in view the seachanges
that have taken place in the polity and economy of India
since the Sarkaria Commission had last looked at the issue of Centre-
State relations over two decades ago.
The terms of reference of the Commission were as follows:
(i) The Commission was required to examine and review the working
of the existing arrangements between the Union and States as
per the Constitution of India, the healthy precedents being
followed, various pronouncements of the Courts in regard to
powers, functions and responsibilities in all spheres including
legislative relations, administrative relations, role of governors,
emergency provisions, financial relations, economic and social
planning, Panchayati Raj institutions, sharing of resources
including inter-state river water and recommend such changes or
other measures as may be appropriate keeping in view the
practical difficulties.
(ii) In examining and reviewing the working of the existing
arrangements between the Union and States and making
recommendations as to the changes and measures needed, the
Commission was required to keep in view the social and
economic developments that have taken place over the years,
particularly over the last two decades and have due regard to the
scheme and framework of the Constitution. Such
recommendations were also needed to address the growing
challenges of ensuring good governance for promoting the
welfare of the people whilst strengthening the unity and integrity of
the country, and of availing emerging opportunities for sustained
and rapid economic growth for alleviating poverty and illiteracy in
the early decades of the new millennium.
(iii) While examining and making its recommendations on the above,
the Commission was required to have particular regard, but not
limit its mandate to the following:-
(a) The role, responsibility and jurisdiction of the Centre vis-a-vis
States during major and prolonged outbreaks of communal
violence, caste violence or any other social conflict leading to
prolonged and escalated violence.
(b) The role, responsibility and jurisdiction of the Centre vis-a-vis
States in the planning and implementation of the mega
projects like the inter-linking of rivers, that would normally
take 15–20 years for completion and hinge vitally on the
support of the States.
(c) The role, responsibility and jurisdiction of the Centre vis-a-vis
States in promoting effective devolution of powers and
autonomy to Panchayati Raj Institutions and Local Bodies
including the Autonomous Bodies under the sixth Schedule of
the Constitution within a specified period of time.
(d) The role, responsibility and jurisdiction of the Centre vis-a-vis
States in promoting the concept and practice of independent
planning and budgeting at the District level.
(e) The role, responsibility and jurisdiction of the Centre vis-a-vis
States in linking Central assistance of various kinds with the
performance of the States.
(f) The role, responsibility and jurisdiction of the Centre in
adopting approaches and policies based on positive
discrimination in favour of backward States.
(g) The impact of the recommendations made by the 8th to 12th
Finance Commissions on the fiscal relations between the
Centre and the States, especially the greater dependence of
the States on devolution of funds from the Centre.
(h) The need and relevance of separate taxes on the production
and on the sales of goods and services subsequent to the
introduction of Value Added Tax regime.
(i) The need for freeing inter-State trade in order to establish a
unified and integrated domestic market as also in the context
of the reluctance of State Governments to adopt the relevant
Sarkaria Commission’s recommendation in chapter XVIII of its
report.
(j) The need for setting up a Central Law Enforcement Agency
empowered to take up suo moto investigation of crimes
having inter-State and/ or international ramifications with
serious implications on national security.
(k) The feasibility of a supporting legislation under Article 355 for
the purpose of suo moto deployment of Central forces in the
States if and when the situation so demands.
The Commission submitted its report to the government in April
2010. In finalising the 1,456 page report, in seven volumes, the
Commission took extensive help from the Sarkaria Commission
report, the National Commission to Review the Working of the
Constitution (NCRWC) report and the Second Administrative Reforms
Commission report. However, in a number of areas, the Commission
report differed from the Sarkaria Commission recommendations.
After examining at length the issues raised in its Terms of
Reference and the related aspects in all their hues and shades, the
Commission came to the conclusion that ‘cooperative federalism’ will
be the key for sustaining India’s unity, integrity and social and
economic development in future. The principles of cooperative
federalism thus may have to act as a practical guide for Indian polity
and governance.
In all, the Commission made over 310 recommendations, touching
upon several significant areas in the working of Centre-state relations.
The important recommendations are mentioned below:
1. To facilitate effective implementation of the laws on List III
subjects, it is necessary that some broad agreement is reached
between the Union and states before introducing legislation in
Parliament on matters in the Concurrent List.
2. The Union should be extremely restrained in asserting
Parliamentary supremacy in matters assigned to the states.
Greater flexibility to states in relation to subjects in the State List
and “transferred items” in the Concurrent List is the key for better
Centre-state relations.
3. The Union should occupy only that many of subjects in
concurrent or overlapping jurisdiction which are absolutely
necessary to achieve uniformity of policy in demonstrable
national interest.
4. There should be a continuing auditing role for the Inter-state
Council in the management of matters in concurrent or
overlapping jurisdiction.
5. The period of six months prescribed in Article 201 for State
Legislature to act when the bill is returned by the President can
be made applicable for the President also to decide on assenting
or withholding assent to a state bill reserved for consideration of
the President.
6. Parliament should make a law on the subject of Entry 14 of List I
(treaty making and implementing it through Parliamentary
legislation) to streamline the procedures involved. The exercise
of the power obviously cannot be absolute or unchartered in
view of the federal structure of legislative and executive powers.
7. Financial obligations and its implications on state finances
arising out of treaties and agreements should be a permanent
term of reference to the Finance Commissions constituted from
time to time.
8. While selecting Governors, the Central Government should
adopt the following strict guidelines as recommended in the
Sarkaria Commission report and follow its mandate in letter and
spirit :
(i) He should be eminent in some walk of life
(ii) He should be a person from outside the state
(iii) He should be a detached figure and not too intimately connec
with the local politics of the state
(iv) He should be a person who has not taken too great a par
politics generally and particularly in the recent past
9. Governors should be given a fixed tenure of five years and their
removal should not be at the sweet will of the Government at the
Centre.
10. The procedure laid down for impeachment of President, mutatis
mutandis can be made applicable for impeachment of Governors
as well.
11. Article 163 does not give the Governor a general discretionary
power to act against or without the advice of his Council of
Ministers. In fact, the area for the exercise of discretion is limited
and even in this limited area, his choice of action should not be
arbitrary or fanciful. It must be a choice dictated by reason,
activated by good faith and tempered by caution.
12. In respect of bills passed by the Legislative Assembly of a state,
the Governor should take the decision within six months whether
to grant assent or to reserve it for consideration of the President.
13. On the question of Governor’s role in appointment of Chief
Minister in the case of an hung assembly, it is necessary to lay
down certain clear guidelines to be followed as Constitutional
conventions. These guidelines may be as follows:
(i) The party or combination of parties which commands the wid
support in the Legislative Assembly should be called upon to f
the Government.
(ii) If there is a pre-poll alliance or coalition, it should be treated
one political party and if such coalition obtains a majority,
leader of such coalition shall be called by the Governor to f
the Government.
(iii) In case no party or pre-poll coalition has a clear majority,
Governor should select the Chief Minister in the order
preference indicated here.
(a) The group of parties which had pre-poll alliance
commanding the largest number
(b) The largest single party staking a claim to form the
government with the support of others
(c) A post-electoral coalition with all partners joining the
government
(d) A post-electoral alliance with some parties joining the
government and the remaining including independents
supporting the government from outside
14. On the question of dismissal of a Chief Minister, the Governor
should invariably insist on the Chief Minister proving his majority
on the floor of the House for which he should prescribe a time
limit.
15. The Governor should have the right to sanction for prosecution
of a state minister against the advice of the Council of Ministers,
if the Cabinet decision appears to the Governor to be motivated
by bias in the face of overwhelming material.
16. The convention of Governors acting as Chancellors of
Universities and holding other statutory positions should be done
away with. His role should be confined to the Constitutional
provisions only.
17. When an external aggression or internal disturbance paralyses
the state administration creating a situation of a potential break
down of the Constitutional machinery of the state, all alternative
courses available to the Union for discharging its paramount
responsibility under Article 355 should be exhausted to contain
the situation and the exercise of the power under Article 356
should be limited strictly to rectifying a “failure of the
Constitutional machinery in the state”.
18. On the question of invoking Article 356 in case of failure of
Constitutional machinery in states, suitable amendments are
required to incorporate the guidelines set forth in the landmark
judgement of the Supreme Court in S.R. Bommai V. Union of
India (1994). This would remove possible misgivings in this
regard on the part of states and help in smoothening Centrestate
relations.
19. Given the strict parameters now set for invoking the emergency
provisions under Articles 352 and 356 to be used only as a
measure of “last resort”, and the duty of the Union to protect
states under Article 355, it is necessary to provide a
Constitutional or legal framework to deal with situations which
require Central intervention but do not warrant invoking the
extreme steps under Articles 352 and 356. Providing the
framework for “localised emergency” would ensure that the state
government can continue to function and the Assembly would
not have to be dissolved while providing a mechanism to let the
Central Government respond to the issue specifically and locally.
The imposition of local emergency is fully justified under the
mandate of Article 355 read with Entry 2A of List I and Entry 1 of
List II of the Seventh Schedule.
20. Suitable amendments to Article 263 are required to make the
Inter-State Council a credible, powerful and fair mechanism for
management of interstate and Centre-state differences.
21. The Zonal Councils should meet at least twice a year with an
agenda proposed by states concerned to maximise co-ordination
and promote harmonisation of policies and action having interstate
ramification. The Secretariat of a strengthened Inter-State
Council can function as the Secretariat of the Zonal Councils as
well.
22. The Empowered Committee of Finance Ministers of States
proved to be a successful experiment in inter-state coordination
on fiscal matters. There is need to institutionalise similar models
in other sectors as well. A forum of Chief Ministers, Chaired by
one of the Chief Minister by rotation can be similarly thought
about particularly to co-ordinate policies of sectors like energy,
food, education, environment and health.
23. New all-India services in sectors like health, education,
engineering and judiciary should be created.
24. Factors inhibiting the composition and functioning of the Second
Chamber as a representative forum of states should be removed
or modified even if it requires amendment of the Constitutional
provisions. In fact, Rajya Sabha offers immense potential to
negotiate acceptable solutions to the friction points which
emerge between Centre and states in fiscal, legislative and
administrative relations.
25. A balance of power between states inter se is desirable and this
is possible by equality of representation in the Rajya Sabha. This
requires amendment of the relevant provisions to give equality of
seats to states in the Rajya Sabha, irrespective of their
population size.
26. The scope of devolution of powers to local bodies to act as
institutions of self-government should be constitutionally defined
through appropriate amendments.
27. All future Central legislations involving states’ involvement
should provide for cost sharing as in the case of the RTE Act.
Existing Central legislations where the states are entrusted with
the responsibility of implementation should be suitably amended
providing for sharing of costs by the Central Government.
28. The royalty rates on major minerals should be revised at least
every three years without any delay. States should be properly
compensated for any delay in the revision of royalty beyond
three years.
29. The current ceiling on profession tax should be completely done
away with by a Constitutional amendment.
30. The scope for raising more revenue from the taxes mentioned in
article 268 should be examined afresh. This issue may be either
referred to the next Finance Commission or an expert committee
be appointed to look into the matter.
31. To bring greater accountability, all fiscal legislations should
provide for an annual assessment by an independent body and
the reports of these bodies should be laid in both Houses of
Parliament/state legislature.
32. Considerations specified in the Terms of Reference (ToR) of the
Finance Commission should be even handed as between the
Centre and the states. There should be an effective mechanism
to involve the states in the finalisation of the ToR of the Finance
Commissions.
33. The Central Government should review all the existing cesses
and surcharges with a view to bringing down their share in the
gross tax revenue.
34. Because of the close linkages between the plan and non-plan
expenditure, an expert committee may be appointed to look into
the issue of distinction between the plan and non-plan
expenditure.
35. There should be much better coordination between the Finance
Commission and the Planning Commission. The synchronisation
of the periods covered by the Finance Commission and the Five-
Year Plan will considerably improve such coordination.
36. The Finance Commission division in the Ministry of Finance
should be converted into a full-fledged department, serving as
the permanent secretariat for the Finance Commissions.
37. The Planning Commission has a crucial role in the current
situation. But its role should be that of coordination rather that of
micro managing sectoral plans of the Central ministries and the
states.
38. Steps should be taken for the setting up of an Inter-State Trade
and Commerce Commission under Article 307 read with Entry
42 of List-I. This Commission should be vested with both
advisory and executive roles with decision making powers. As a
Constitutional body, the decisions of the Commission should be
final and binding on all states as well as the Union of India. Any
party aggrieved with the decision of the Commission may prefer
an appeal to the Supreme Court.
The Report of the Commission was circulated to all stakeholders
including State Governments / UT Administrations and Union
Ministries / Departments concerned for their considered views on the
recommendations of the Commission. The comments received from
the Union Ministries / Departments and the State Governments / UT
Administrations are under the consideration of the Inter-State
Council.
