# ELECTION


The Vice-President, like the president, is elected not directly by
the people but by the method of indirect election. He is elected by
the members of an electoral college consisting of the members of
both Houses of Parliament.1 Thus, this electoral college is
different from the electoral college for the election of the President
in the following two respects:
1. It consists of both elected and nominated members of the
Parliament (in the case of president, only elected members).
2. It does not include the members of the state legislative
assemblies (in the case of President, the elected members
of the state legislative assemblies are included). Explaining
the reason for this difference, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar observed:2
“The President is the head of the State and his power extends
both to the administration by the Centre as well as to the states.
Consequently, it is necessary that in his election, not only
members of Parliament should play their part, but the members of
the state legislatures should have a voice. But, when we come to
the Vice-President, his normal functions are to preside over the
council of states. It is only on a rare occasion, and that too for a
temporary period, that he may be called upon to assume the
duties of the president. That being so, it does not seem necessary
that the members of the state legislatures should also be invited to
take part in the election of the Vice-President”.
But, the manner of election is same in both the cases. Thus,
the Vice-President’s election, like that of the President’s election,
is held in accordance with the system of proportional
representation by means of the single transferable vote and the
voting is by secret ballot.3
All doubts and disputes in connection with election of the Vice-
President are inquired into and decided by the Supreme Court
whose decision is final. The election of a person as Vice-President
cannot be challenged on the ground that the electoral college was
incomplete (i.e., existence of any vacancy among the members of
electoral college). If the election of a person as VicePresident is
declared void by the Supreme Court, acts done by him before the
date of such declaration of the Supreme Court are not invalidated
(i.e., they continue to remain in force).
# QUALIFICATIONS,  OATH AND  CONDITIONS


Qualifications
To be eligible for election as Vice-President, a person should fulfil
the following qualifications:
1. He should be a citizen of India.
2. He should have completed 35 years of age.
3. He should be qualified for election as a member of the Rajya
Sabha.
4. He should not hold any office of profit under the Union
government or any state government or any local authority
or any other public authority.

But, a sitting President or Vice-President of the Union, the
governor of any state and a minister for the Union or any state is
not deemed to hold any office of profit and hence qualified for
being a candidate for Vice-President.
Further, the nomination of a candidate for election to the office
of Vice-President must be subscribed by at least 20 electors as
proposers and 20 electors as seconders. Every candidate has to
make a security deposit of ₹15,000 in the Reserve Bank of India.4
Oath or Affirmation
Before entering upon his office, the VicePresident has to make
and subscribe to an oath or affirmation. In his oath, the
VicePresident swears:
1. to bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India;
and
2. to faithfully discharge the duties of his office.
The oath of office to the Vice-President is administered by the
President or some person appointed in that behalf by him.
Conditions of Office
The Constitution lays down the following two conditions of the
Vice-President’s office:
1. He should not be a member of either House of Parliament or
a House of the state legislature. If any such person is
elected Vice-President, he is deemed to have vacated his
seat in that House on the date on which he enters upon his
office as Vice-President.
2. He should not hold any other office of profit.
# TERM AND  VACANCY


Term of Office
The Vice-President holds office for a term of five years from the
date on which he enters upon his office. However, he can resign
from his office at any time by addressing the resignation letter to
the President. He can also be removed from the office before
completion of his term. A formal impeachment is not required for
his removal. He can be removed by a resolution passed by a
majority of all the then members of the Rajya Sabha and agreed
to by the Lok Sabha. This means that this resolution should be
passed in the Rajya Sabha by an effective majority and in the Lok
Sabha by a simple majority. It must be noted here that the
effective majority in India is only a type of special majority and not
a separate one. Further, this resolution can be introduced only in
the Rajya Sabha and not in the Lok Sabha. But, no such
resolution can be moved unless at least 14 days’ advance notice
has been given. Notably, no ground has been mentioned in the
Constitution for his removal.
The Vice-President can hold office beyond his term of five
years until his successor assumes charge. He is also eligible for
reelection to that office. He may be elected for any number of
terms.5
Vacancy in Office
A vacancy in the Vice-President’s office can occur in any of the
following ways:
1. On the expiry of his tenure of five years.
2. By his resignation.
3. On his removal.
4. By his death.6
5. Otherwise, for example, when he becomes disqualified to
hold office or when his election is declared void.
When the vacancy is going to be caused by the expiration of
the term of the sitting vicepresident, an election to fill the vacancy
must be held before the expiration of the term.
If the office falls vacant by resignation, removal, death or
otherwise, then election to fill the vacancy should be held as soon
as possible after the occurrence of the vacancy. The newlyelected
vice-president remains in office for a full term of five years
from the date he assumes charge of his office.

# POWERS AND  FUNCTIONS


The functions of Vice-President are two-fold:
1. He acts as the ex-officio Chairman of Rajya Sabha. In this
capacity, his powers and functions are similar to those of the
Speaker of Lok Sabha. In this respect, he resembles the
American vicepresident who also acts as the Chairman of
the Senate–the Upper House of the American legislature.
2. He acts as President when a vacancy occurs in the office of
the President due to his resignation, impeachment, death or
otherwise.7 He can act as President only for a maximum
period of six months within which a new President has to be
elected. Further, when the sitting President is unable to
discharge his functions due to absence, illness or any other
cause, the Vice-President discharges his functions until the
President resumes his office.8
While acting as President or discharging the functions of
President, the Vice-President does not perform the duties of the
office of the chairman of Rajya Sabha. During this period, those
duties are performed by the Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha.
The Constitution has not fixed any emoluments for the Vice-
President in that capacity. He draws his regular salary in his
capacity as the ex-officio Chairman of the Rajya Sabha. In 2018,
the Parliament increased the salary of the Chairman of the Rajya
Sabha from ₹1.25 lakh to ₹4 lakh per month9. Earlier in 2008, the
pension of the retired Vice-President was increased from ₹20,000
per month to 50% of his salary per month10. In addition, he is
entitled to daily allowance, free furnished residence, medical,
travel and other facilities.
During any period when the Vice-President acts as President or
discharges the functions of the President, he is not entitled to the
salary or allowance payable to the Chairman of Rajya Sabha, but
the salary and allowance of the President.
# INDIAN AND  AMERICAN  VICE PRESIDENTS


# COMPARED


Though the office of the Indian VicePresident is modelled on the
lines of the American Vice-President, there is a difference. The
American Vice-President succeeds to the presidency when it falls
vacant, and remains President for the unexpired term of his
predecessor. The Indian Vice-President, on the other hand, does
not assume the office of the President when it falls vacant for the
unexpired term. He merely serves as an acting President until the
new President assumes charge.
From the above it is clear that the Constitution has not
assigned any significant function to the Vice-President in that
capacity. Hence, some scholars call him ‘His Superfluous
Highness’. This office was created with a view to maintain the
political continuity of the Indian State.

I
19 Prime Minister
n the scheme of parliamentary system of government provided
by the constitution, the President is the nominal executive
authority (de jure executive) and Prime Minister is the real
executive authority (de facto executive). In other words, president
is the head of the State while Prime Minister is the head of the
government.
# APPOINTMENT OF THE  PRIME  MINISTER


The Constitution does not contain any specific procedure for the
selection and appointment of the Prime Minister. Article 75 says
only that the Prime Minister shall be appointed by the president.
However, this does not imply that the president is free to appoint
any one as the Prime Minister. In accordance with the conventions
of the parliamentary system of government, the President has to
appoint the leader of the majority party in the Lok Sabha as the
Prime Minister. But, when no party has a clear majority in the Lok
Sabha, then the President may exercise his personal discretion in
the selection and appointment of the Prime Minister. In such a
situation, the President usually appoints the leader of the largest
party or coalition in the Lok Sabha as the Prime Minister and asks
him to seek a vote of confidence in the House within a month.
This discretion was exercised by the President, for the first time in
1979, when Neelam Sanjiva Reddy (the then President) appointed
Charan Singh (the coalition leader) as the Prime Minister after the
fall of the Janata Party government headed by Morarji Desai.
There is also one more situation when the president may have
to exercise his individual judgement in the selection and
appointment of the Prime Minister, that is, when the Prime
Minister in office dies suddenly and there is no obvious successor.
This is what happened when Indira Gandhi was assassinated in
1984. The then President Zail Singh appointed Rajiv Gandhi as
the Prime Minister by ignoring the precedent of appointing a
caretaker Prime Minister.1 Later on, the Congress parliamentary
party unanimously elected him as its leader. However, if, on the
death of an incumbent Prime Minister, the ruling party elects a
new leader, the President has no choice but to appoint him as
Prime Minister.
In 1980, the Delhi High Court held that the Constitution does
not require that a person must prove his majority in the Lok Sabha
before he is appointed as the Prime Minister. The President may
first appoint him the Prime Minister and then ask him to prove his
majority in the Lok Sabha within a reasonable period. For
example, Charan Singh (1979), V.P. Singh (1989), Chandrasekhar
(1990), P.V. Narasimha Rao (1991), A.B. Vajyapee (1996), Deve
Gowda (1996), I.K. Gujral (1997) and again A.B. Vajpayee (1998)
were appointed as Prime Ministers in this way.
In 1997, the Supreme Court held that a person who is not a
member of either House of Parliament can be appointed as Prime
Minister for six months, within which, he should become a
member of either House of Parliament; otherwise, he ceases to be
the Prime Minister.
Constitutionally, the Prime Minister may be a member of any of
the two Houses of parliament. For example, three Prime Ministers,
Indira Gandhi (1966), Deve Gowda (1996) and Manmohan Singh
(2004), were members of the Rajya Sabha. In Britain, on the other
hand, the Prime Minister should definitely be a member of the
Lower House (House of Commons).
# OATH,  TERM AND  SALARY


Before the Prime Minister enters upon his office, the president
administers to him the oaths of office and secrecy.2 In his oath of
office, the Prime Minister swears:
1. to bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India,
2. to uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India,
3. to faithfully and conscientiously discharge the duties of his
office, and
4. to do right to all manner of people in accordance with the
Constitution and the law, without fear or favour, affection or
ill will.
In his oath of secrecy, the Prime Minister swears that he will not
directly or indirectly communicate or reveal to any person(s) any
matter that is brought under his consideration or becomes known
to him as a Union Minister except as may be required for the due
discharge of his duties as such minister.
The term of the Prime Minister is not fixed and he holds office
during the pleasure of the president. However, this does not mean
that the president can dismiss the Prime Minister at any time. So
long as the Prime Minister enjoys the majority support in the Lok
Sabha, he cannot be dismissed by the President. However, if he
loses the confidence of the Lok Sabha, he must resign or the
President can dismiss him.3
The salary and allowances of the Prime Minister are
determined by the Parliament from time to time. He gets the
salary and allowances that are payable to a member of
Parliament. Additionally, he gets a sumptuary allowance, free
accommodation, travelling allowance, medical facilities, etc. In
2001, the Parliament increased his sumptuary allowance from
₹1,500 to ₹3,000 per month.
# POWERS AND  FUNCTIONS OF THE  PRIME


# MINISTER


The powers and functions of Prime Minister can be studied under
the following heads:
In Relation to Council of Ministers
The Prime Minister enjoys the following powers as head of the
Union council of ministers:
1. He recommends persons who can be appointed as ministers
by the president. The President can appoint only those
persons as ministers who are recommended by the Prime
Minister.
2. He allocates and reshuffles various portfolios among the
ministers.
3. He can ask a minister to resign or advise the President to
dismiss him in case of difference of opinion.
4. He presides over the meeting of council of ministers and
influences its decisions.
5. He guides, directs, controls, and coordinates the activities of
all the ministers.
6. He can bring about the collapse of the council of ministers
by resigning from office.
Since the Prime Minister stands at the head of the council of
ministers, the other ministers cannot function when the Prime
Minister resigns or dies. In other words, the resignation or death of
an incumbent Prime Minister automatically dissolves the council of
ministers and thereby generates a vacuum. The resignation or
death of any other minister, on the other hand, merely creates a
vacancy which the Prime Minister may or may not like to fill.
In Relation to the President
The Prime Minister enjoys the following powers in relation to the
President:
1. He is the principal channel of communication between the
President and the council of ministers.4 It is the duty of the
prime minister:
(a) to communicate to the President all decisions of the
council of ministers relating to the administration of the
affairs of the Union and proposals for legislation;
(b) to furnish such information relating to the administration
of the affairs of the Union and proposals for legislation as
the President may call for; and
(c) if the President so requires, to submit for the
consideration of the council of ministers any matter on
which a decision has been taken by a minister but which
has not been considered by the council.
2. He advises the president with regard to the appointment of
important officials like attorney general of India, Comptroller
and Auditor General of India, chairman and members of the
# UPSC, election commissioners, chairman and members of


the finance commission and so on.
In Relation to Parliament
The Prime Minister is the leader of the Lower House. In this
capacity, he enjoys the following powers:
1. He advises the President with regard to summoning and
proroguing of the sessions of the Parliament.
2. He can recommend dissolution of the Lok Sabha to
President at any time.
3. He announces government policies on the floor of the
House.
Other Powers & Functions
In addition to the above-mentioned three major roles, the Prime
Minister has various other roles. These are:
1. He is the chairman of the # NITI Ayog (which succeded the


planning commission), National Integration Council,
InterState Council, National Water Resources Council and
some other bodies.
2. He plays a significant role in shaping the foreign policy of the
country.
3. He is the chief spokesman of the Union government.
4. He is the crisis manager-in-chief at the political level during
emergencies.
5. As a leader of the nation, he meets various sections of
people in different states and receives memoranda from
them regarding their problems, and so on.
6. He is leader of the party in power.
7. He is political head of the services.
Thus, the Prime Minister plays a very significant and highly
crucial role in the politico-administrative system of the country. Dr.
B.R. Ambedkar stated, ‘If any functionary under our constitution is
to be compared with the US president, he is the Prime Minister
and not the president of the Union’.
# ROLE  DESCRIPTIONS


The various comments made by the eminent political scientists
and constitutional experts on the role of Prime Minister in Britain
holds good in the Indian context also. These are mentioned
below:
Lord Morely
He described Prime Minister as ‘primus inter pares’ (first among
equals) and ‘key stone of the cabinet arch’. He said, “The head of
the cabinet is ‘primus inter pares’, and occupied a position which
so long as it lasts, is one of exceptional and peculiar authority”.
Herbert Marrison
“As the head of the Government, he (prime minister) is ‘primus
inter pares’. But, it is today for too modest an appreciation of the
Prime Minister’s position”.
Sir William Vernor Harcourt
He described Prime Minister as ‘inter stellas luna minores’ (a
moon among lesser stars).
Jennings
“He is, rather, a sun around which planets revolve. He is the keystone
of the constitution. All roads in the constitution lead to the
Prime Minister.”
H.J. Laski
On the relationship between the Prime Minister and the cabinet,
he said that the Prime Minister “is central to its formation, central
to its life, and central to its death”. He described him as “the pivot
around which the entire governmental machinery revolves.”
H.R.G. Greaves
“The Government is the master of the country and he (Prime
Minister) is the master of the Government.”
Munro
He called Prime Minister as “the captain of the ship of the state”.
Ramsay Muir
He described Prime Minister as “the steersman of steering wheel
of the ship of the state.”
The role of the Prime Minister in the British parliamentary
government is so significant and crucial that observers like to call
it a ‘Prime Ministerial government.’ Thus, R.H. Crossman says,
‘The post-war epoch has been the final transformation of cabinet
government into Prime Ministerial government.’ Similarly,
Humphrey Berkely points out, ‘Parliament is not, in practice,
sovereign. The parliamentary democracy has now collapsed at
Westminster. The basic defect in the British system of governing is
the super-ministerial powers of the Prime Minister.’ The same
description holds good to the Indian context too.
# RELATIONSHIP  WITH THE  PRESIDENT


The following provisions of the Constitution deal with the
relationship between the President and the Prime Minister:
1. Article 74
There shall be a council of ministers with the Prime Minister at the
head to aid and advise the President who shall, in the exercise of
his functions, act in accordance with such advice. However, the
President may require the council of ministers to reconsider such
advice and the President shall act in accordance with the advice
tendered after such reconsideration.
2. Article 75
(a) The Prime Minister shall be appointed by the President and
the other ministers shall be appointed by the president on the
advice of the Prime Minister; (b) The ministers shall hold office
during the pleasure of the president; and (c) The council of
ministers shall be collectively responsible to the House of the
People.
3. Article 78
It shall be the duty of the Prime Minister:
(a) to communicate to the President all decisions of the council
of ministers relating to the administration of the affairs of the
Union and proposals for legislation;
(b) to furnish such information relating to the administration of
the affairs of the Union and proposals for legislation as the
President may call for; and
(c) if the President so requires, to submit for the consideration of
the council of ministers any matter on which a decision has
been taken by a minister but which has not been considered
by the council.
# CHIEF  MINISTERS WHO  BECAME  PRIME  MINISTERS


Six people–Morarji Desai, Charan Singh, V.P. Singh, P.V.
Narasimha Rao, H.D. Deve Gowda and Narendra Modi–became
Prime Ministers after being Chief Ministers of their respective
States. Morarji Desai, Chief Minister of the erstwhile Bombay
State during 1952–56, became the first non-Congress Prime
Minister in March 1977. Charan Singh, who succeeded him, was
the Chief Minister of the undivided Uttar Pradesh in 1967–1968
and again in 1970. V.P. Singh, also from U.P., became Prime
Minister in the short lived National Front government (December
1989-November 1990). P.V. Narasimha Rao, the first Prime
Minister from South India, who held the post from 1991–1996,
was Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh between 1971–1973. H.D.
Deve Gowda was Chief Minister of Karnataka when he was
chosen to lead the United Front government in June 19965 .
Narendra Modi (BJP) was the Chief Minister of Gujarat when
he became the Prime Minister in May 2014. He served as the
Chief Minister of Gujarat for four times during 2001 to 2014.

# NOTES AND  REFERENCES


1. On the death of Jawaharlal Nehru and Lal Bahadur
Shastri when the leadership was contested, the
president made temporary arrangements by appointing
the seniormost minister as the Prime Minister, until the
formal election of the leader by the party. Both the
times, it was Gulzari Lal Nanda who acted as the Prime
Minister.
2. The form of oath of office and secrecy for the Prime
Minister is similar to that for any Union minister. See
Chapter 20.
3. For example, V.P. Singh in 1990 and Deve Gowda in
1997 resigned after defeat in the Lok Sabha.
4. Article 78 specifically deals with this function of the
Prime Minister.

A
20 Central Council of Ministers
s the Constitution of India provides for a parliamentary
system of government modelled on the British pattern, the
council of ministers headed by the prime minister is the
real executive authority is our politico-administrative system.
The principles of parliamentary system of government are not
detailed in the Constitution, but two Articles (74 and 75) deal with
them in a broad, sketchy and general manner. Article 74 deals
with the status of the council of ministers while Article 75 deals
with the appointment, tenure, responsibility, qualification, oath and
salaries and allowances of the ministers.
# CONSTITUTIONAL  PROVISIONS


Article 74—Council of Ministers to aid and advise
President
1. There shall be a Council of Ministers with the Prime Minister
at the head to aid and advise the President who shall, in the
exercise of his functions, act in accordance with such
advice. However, the President may require the Council of
Ministers to reconsider such advice and the President shall
act in accordance with the advice tendered after such
reconsideration.
2. The advice tendered by Ministers to the President shall not
be inquired into in any court.
Article 75–Other Provisions as to Ministers

the other Ministers shall be appointed by the President on
the advice of the Prime Minister.
2. The total number of ministers, including the Prime Minister,
in the Council of Ministers shall not exceed 15% of the total
strength of the Lok Sabha. This provision was added by the
91st Amendment Act of 2003.
3. A member of either house of Parliament belonging to any
political party who is disqualified on the ground of defection
shall also be disqualified to be appointed as a minister. This
provision was also added by the 91st Amendment Act of
2003.
4. The ministers shall hold office during the pleasure of the
President.
5. The council of ministers shall be collectively responsible to
the Lok Sabha.
6. The President shall administer the oaths of office and
secrecy to a minister.

house) for any period of six consecutive months shall cease
to be a minister.
8. The salaries and allowances of ministers shall be
determined by the Parliament.
Article 77–Conduct of Business of the Government of

expressed to be taken in the name of the President.
2. Orders and other instruments made and executed in the
name of the President shall be authenticated in such manner

that it is not an order or instrument made or executed by the
President.
3. The President shall make rules for the more convenient
transaction of the business of the Government of India, and
for the allocation among Ministers of the said business.
Article 78–Duties of Prime Minister
It shall be the duty of the Prime Minister
1. To communicate to the President all decisions of the Council
of Ministers relating to the administration of the affairs of the
Union and proposals for legislation
2. To furnish such information relating to the administration of
the affairs of the Union and proposals for legislation as the
President may call for
3. If the President so requires, to submit for the consideration

Article 88–Rights of Ministers as Respects the Houses
Every minister shall have the right to speak and take part in the
proceedings of either House, any joint sitting of the Houses and
any Committee of Parliament of which he may be named a
member. But he shall not be entitled to vote.
# NATURE OF  ADVICE BY  MINISTERS


Article 74 provides for a council of ministers with the Prime
Minister at the head to aid and advise the President in the
exercise of his functions. The 42nd and 44th Constitutional
Amendment Acts have made the advice binding on the
President.1 Further, the nature of advice tendered by ministers to
the President cannot be enquired by any court. This provision
emphasises the intimate and the confidential relationship between
the President and the ministers.
In 1971, the Supreme Court held that ‘even after the dissolution
of the Lok Sabha, the council of ministers does not cease to hold
office. Article 74 is mandatory and, therefore, the president cannot
exercise the executive power without the aid and advise of the
council of ministers. Any exercise of executive power without the
aid and advice will be unconstitutional as being violative of Article
74’. Again in 1974, the court held that ‘wherever the Constitution
requires the satisfaction of the President, the satisfaction is not
the personal satisfaction of the President but it is the satisfaction
of the council of ministers with whose aid and on whose advice
the President exercises his powers and functions’.
# APPOINTMENT OF  MINISTERS


The Prime Minister is appointed by the President, while the other
ministers are appointed by the President on the advice of the
Prime Minister. This means that the President can appoint only
those persons as ministers who are recommended by the Prime
minister.
Usually, the members of Parliament, either Lok Sabha or Rajya
Sabha, are appointed as ministers. A person who is not a member
of either House of Parliament can also be appointed as a minister.
But, within six months, he must become a member (either by
election or by nomination) of either House of Parliament,
otherwise, he ceases to be a minister.
A minister who is a member of one House of Parliament has
the right to speak and to take part in the proceedings of the other
House also, but he can vote only in the House of which he is a
member.
# OATH AND  SALARY OF  MINISTERS


Before a minister enters upon his office, the president administers
to him the oaths of office and secrecy. In his oath of office, the
minister swears:
1. to bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India,
2. to uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India,
3. to faithfully and conscientiously discharge the duties of his
office, and
4. to do right to all manner of people in accordance with the
Constitution and the law, without fear or favour, affection or
ill will.
In his oath of secrecy, the minister swears that he will not
directly or indirectly communicate or reveal to any person(s) any
matter that is brought under his consideration or becomes known
to him as a Union minister except as may be required for the due
discharge of his duties as such minister.
In 1990, the oath by Devi Lal as deputy prime minister was
challenged as being unconstitutional as the Constitution provides
only for the Prime Minister and ministers. The Supreme Court
upheld the oath as valid and stated that describing a person as
Deputy Prime Minister is descriptive only and such description
does not confer on him any powers of Prime Minister. It ruled that
the description of a minister as Deputy Prime Minister or any other
type of minister such as minister of state or deputy minister of
which there is no mention in the Constitution does not vitiate the
oath taken by him so long as the substantive part of the oath is
correct.
The salaries and allowances of ministers are determined by
Parliament from time to time.2 A minister gets the salary and
allowances that are payable to a member of Parliament.
Additionally, he gets a sumptuary allowance (according to his
rank), free accommodation, travelling allowance, medical facilities,
etc. In 2001, the sumptuary allowance for the prime minister was
raised from ₹1,500 to ₹3,000 per month, for a cabinet minister
from ₹1,000 to ₹2,000 per month, for a minister of state from ₹500
to ₹1,000 per month and for a deputy minister from ₹300 to ₹600
per month.
# RESPONSIBILITY OF  MINISTERS


Collective Responsibility
The fundamental principle underlying the working of parliamentary
system of government is the principle of collective responsibility.
Article 75 clearly states that the council of ministers is collectively
responsible to the Lok Sabha. This means that all the ministers
own joint responsibility to the Lok Sabha for all their acts of
ommission and commission. They work as a team and swim or
sink together. When the Lok Sabha passes a no-confidence
motion against the council of ministers, all the ministers have to
resign including those ministers who are from the Rajya Sabha.3
Alternatively, the council of ministers can advise the president to
dissolve the Lok Sabha on the ground that the House does not
represent the views of the electorate faithfully and call for fresh
elections. The President may not oblige the council of ministers
that has lost the confidence of the Lok Sabha.
The principle of collective responsibility also means that the
Cabinet decisions bind all cabinet ministers (and other ministers)
even if they differed in the cabinet meeting. It is the duty of every
minister to stand by cabinet decisions and support them both
within and outside the Parliament. If any minister disagrees with a
cabinet decision and is not prepared to defend it, he must resign.
Several ministers have resigned in the past owing to their
differences with the cabinet. For example, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar
resigned because of his differences with his colleagues on the
Hindu Code Bill in 1953. C.D. Deshmukh resigned due to his
differences on the policy of reorganisation of states. Arif
Mohammed resigned due to his opposition to the Muslim Women
(Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986.
Individual Responsibility
Article 75 also contains the principle of individual responsibility. It
states that the ministers hold office during the pleasure of the
president, which means that the President can remove a minister
even at a time when the council of ministers enjoys the confidence
of the Lok Sabha. However, the President removes a minister only
on the advice of the Prime Minister. In case of a difference of
opinion or dissatisfaction with the performance of a minister, the
Prime Minister can ask him to resign or advice the President to
dismiss him. By exercising this power, the Prime Minister can
ensure the realisation of the rule of collective responsibility. In this
context, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar observed:
“Collective responsibility can be achieved only through the
instrumentality of the Prime Minister. Therefore, unless and
until we create that office and endow that office with statutory
authority to nominate and dismiss ministers, there can be no
collective responsibility.”4
No Legal Responsibility
In Britain, every order of the King for any public act is
countersigned by a minister. If the order is in violation of any law,
the minister would be held responsible and would be liable in the
court. The legally accepted phrase in Britain is, “The king can do
no wrong.” Hence, he cannot be sued in any court.
In India, on the other hand, there is no provision in the
Constitution for the system of legal responsibility of a minister. It is
not required that an order of the President for a public act should
be countersigned by a minister. Moreover, the courts are barred
from enquiring into the nature of advice rendered by the ministers
to the president.
# COMPOSITION OF THE  COUNCIL OF  MINISTERS


The council of ministers consists of three categories of ministers,
namely, cabinet ministers, ministers of state,5 and deputy
ministers. The difference between them lies in their respective
ranks, emoluments, and political importance. At the top of all
these ministers stands the Prime Minister–the supreme governing
authority of the country.
The cabinet ministers head the important ministries of the
Central government like home, defence, finance, external affairs
and so forth. They are members of the cabinet, attend its
meetings and play an important role in deciding policies. Thus,
their responsibilities extend over the entire gamut of Central
government.
The ministers of state can either be given independent charge
of ministries/ departments or can be attached to cabinet ministers.
In case of attachment, they may either be given the charge of
departments of the ministries headed by the cabinet ministers or
allotted specific items of work related to the ministries headed by
cabinet ministers. In both the cases, they work under the
supervision and guidance as well as under the overall charge and
responsibility of the cabinet ministers. In case of independent
charge, they perform the same functions and exercise the same
powers in relation to their ministries/departments as cabinet
ministers do. However, they are not members of the cabinet and
do not attend the cabinet meetings unless specially invited when
something related to their ministries/ departments are considered
by the cabinet.
Next in rank are the deputy ministers. They are not given
independent charge of ministries/departments. They are attached
to the cabinet ministers or ministers of state and assist them in
their administrative, political, and parliamentary duties. They are
not members of the cabinet and do not attend cabinet meetings.
It must also be mentioned here that there is one more category
of ministers, called parliamentary secretaries. They are the
members of the last category of the council of ministers (which is
also known as the ‘ministry’). They have no department under
their control. They are attached to the senior ministers and assist
them in the discharge of their parliamentary duties. However,
since 1967, no parliamentary secretaries have been appointed
except during the first phase of Rajiv Gandhi Government.
At times, the council of ministers may also include a deputy
prime minister. The deputy prime ministers are appointed mostly
for political reasons.
# COUNCIL OF  MINISTERS VS  CABINET


The words ‘council of ministers’ and ‘cabinet’ are often used
interchangeably though there is a definite distinction between
them. They differ from each other in respects of composition,
functions, and role. These differences are shown in Table 20.1.
# ROLE OF  CABINET


1. It is the highest decision-making authority in our politicoadministrative
system.
2. It is the chief policy formulating body of the Central
government.
3. It is the supreme executive authority of the Central
government.
4. It is chief coordinator of Central administration.
5. It is an advisory body to the president and its advice is
binding on him.
6. It is the chief crisis manager and thus deals with all
emergency situations.
7. It deals with all major legislative and financial matters.
8. It exercises control over higher appointments like
constitutional authorities and senior secretariat
administrators.
9. It deals with all foreign policies and foreign affairs.

# ROLE  DESCRIPTIONS


The various comments made by the eminent political scientists
and constitutional experts on the role of cabinet in Britain holds
good in the Indian context also. These are mentioned below.
Ramsay Muir
“The Cabinet is the steering wheel of the ship of the state.”
Lowell
“The Cabinet is the keystone of the political arch”.
Sir John Marriott
“The Cabinet is the pivot around which the whole political
machinery revolves”.
Gladstone
“The Cabinet is the solar orb around which the other bodies
revolve”.
Barker
“The Cabinet is the magnet of policy”.
Bagehot
“The Cabinet is a hyphen that joins, the buckle that binds the
executive and legislative departments together”.
Sir Ivor Jennings
“The Cabinet is the core of the British Constitutional System. It
provides unity to the British system of Government”.
L.S. Amery
“The Cabinet is the central directing instrument of Government”.
The position of the Cabinet in the British Government has
become so strong that Ramsay Muir referred to it as the
‘Dictatorship of the Cabinet’. In his book ‘How Britain is
Governed’, he writes “A body which wields such powers as these
may fairly be described as ‘omnipotent’ in theory, however,
incapable it may be of using its omnipotence. Its position,
whenever it commands a majority, is a dictatorship only qualified
by publicity. This dictatorship is far more absolute that it was two
generations ago”. The same description holds good in the Indian
context too.
# KITCHEN  CABINET


The cabinet, a small body consisting of the prime minister as its
head and some 15 to 20 most important ministers, is the highest
decision-making body in the formal sense. However, a still smaller
body called the ‘Inner Cabinet’ or ‘Kitchen Cabinet’ has become
the real centre of power. This informal body consists of the Prime
Minister and two to four influential colleagues in whom he has
faith and with whom he can discuss every problem. It advises the
prime minister on important political and administrative issues and
assists him in making crucial decisions. It is composed of not only
cabinet ministers but also outsiders like friends and family
members of the prime minister.
Every prime minister in India has had his ‘Inner Cabinet’–a
circle within a circle. During the era of Indira Gandhi, the ‘Inner
Cabinet’ which came to be called the ‘Kitchen Cabinet’ was
particularly powerful.
The prime ministers have resorted to the device of ‘inner
cabinet’ (extra-constitutional body) due to its merits, namely:
1. It being a small unit, is much more efficient decision-making
body than a large cabinet.
2. It can meet more often and deal with business much more
expeditiously than the large cabinet.
3. It helps the Prime Minister in maintaining secrecy in making
decisions on important political issues.
However, it has many demerits also. Thus,6
1. It reduces the authority and status of the cabinet as the
highest decision-making body.
2. It circumvents the legal process by allowing outside persons
to play an influential role in the government functioning.
The phenomenon of ‘kitchen cabinet’ (where decisions are
cooked and placed before the cabinet for formal approval) is not
unique to India. It also exists in USA and Britain and is quite
powerful in influencing government decisions there.

21 Cabinet Committees
# FEATURES OF  CABINET  COMMITTEES


The following are the features of Cabinet Committees:
1. They are extra-constitutional in emergence. In other words,
they are not mentioned in the Constitution. However, the
Rules of Business provide for their establishment.
2. They are of two types–standing and ad hoc. The former are
of a permanent nature while the latter are of a temporary
nature. The ad hoc committees are constituted from time to
time to deal with special problems. They are disbanded after
their task is completed.1
3. They are set up by the Prime Minister according to the
exigencies of the time and requirements of the situation.
Hence, their number, nomenclature, and composition varies
from time to time.
4. Their membership varies from three to eight. They usually
include only Cabinet Ministers. However, the non-cabinet
Ministers are not debarred from their membership.
5. They not only include the Ministers in charge of subjects
covered by them but also include other senior Ministers.
6. They are mostly headed by the Prime Minister. Some times
other Cabinet Ministers, particularly the Home Minister or the
Finance Minister, also acts as their Chairman. But, in case
the Prime Minister is a member of a committee, he invariably
presides over it.
7. They not only sort out issues and formulate proposals for the
consideration of the Cabinet, but also take decisions.
However, the Cabinet can review their decisions.
8. They are an organisational device to reduce the enormous
workload of the Cabinet. They also facilitate in-depth
examination of policy issues and effective coordination. They
are based on the principles of division of labour and effective
delegation.
# LIST OF  CABINET  COMMITTEES


In 1994, there were the following 13 Cabinet Committees:
1. Cabinet Committee on Political Affairs
2. Cabinet Committee on Natural Calamities
3. Cabinet Committee on Parliamentary Affairs
4. Appointments Committee of the Cabinet
5. Cabinet Committee on Accommodation
6. Cabinet Committee on Foreign Investment
7. Cabinet Committee on Drug Abuse Control
8. Cabinet Committee on Prices
9. Cabinet Committee on Minority Welfare
10. Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs
11. Cabinet Committee on Trade and Investment
12. Cabinet Committee on Expenditure
13. Cabinet Committee on Infrastructure
In 2013, the following 10 Cabinet Committees were in existence:
1. Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs
2. Cabinet Committee on Prices
3. Cabinet Committee on Political Affairs
4. Appointments Committee of the Cabinet
5. Cabinet Committee on Security
6. Cabinet Committee on World Trade Organisation (WTO)
Matters
7. Cabinet Committee on Investment
8. Cabinet Committee on Unique Identification Authority of
India (# UIDAI) related issues


9. Cabinet Committee on Parliamentary Affairs
10. Cabinet Committee on Accommodation
At present (2019), the following 8 Cabinet Committees are
functional:
1. Cabinet Committee on Political Affairs
2. Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs
3. Appointments Committee of the Cabinet
4. Cabinet Committee on Security
5. Cabinet Committee on Parliamentary Affairs
6. Cabinet Committee on Accommodation
7. Cabinet Committee on Investment and Growth
8. Cabinet Committee on Employment and Skill Development
# FUNCTIONS OF  CABINET  COMMITTEES


The following four are the more important cabinet committees:
1. The Political Affairs Committee deals with all policy matters
pertaining to domestic and foreign affairs.
2. The Economic Affairs Committee directs and coordinates
the governmental activities in the economic sphere.
3. Appointments Committee decides all higher level
appointments in the Central Secretariat, Public Enterprises,
Banks and Financial Institutions.
4. Parliamentary Affairs Committee looks after the progress of
government business in the Parliament.
The first three committees are chaired by the Prime Minister
and the last one by the Home Minister. Of all the Cabinet
Committees, the most powerful is the Political Affairs Committee,
often described as a “Super-Cabinet”.
# GROUPS OF  MINISTERS


In addition to cabinet committees, several Groups of Ministers
(GoMs) are constituted to look into different issues / subjects.
Some of these GoMs are empowered to take decisions on behalf
of the Cabinet whereas the others make recommendations to the
Cabinet.2
The institution of GoMs has become a viable and effective
instrument of coordination among the ministries. These are ad hoc
bodies formed to give recommendations to the cabinet on certain
emergent issues and critical problem areas. Ministers heading the
concerned ministries are inducted into the relevant GoMs and
when the advice is crystallised they are disbanded.3
The Second Administrative Reforms Commission (2005–2009)
made the following observations and recommendations with
respect to the working of the GoMs4 :
1. The Commission observed that the constitution of a large
number of GoMs has resulted in many GoMs not being able
to meet regularly to complete their work thus leading to
significant delays on many major issues.
2. The Commission felt that more selective use of the
institution of GoMs would perhaps lead to more effective
coordination particularly if they are empowered to arrive at a
decision on behalf of the Cabinet with time limits that are
prescribed for completing the work entrusted to them.
3. The Commission recommended that there is need to ensure
that the existing coordination mechanism of GoMs function
effectively and helps in early resolution of issues. Selective,
but effective use of GoMs with clear mandate and prescribed
time limits would be helpful.

T
22 Parliament
he Parliament is the legislative organ of the Union
government. It occupies a pre-eminent and central position
in the Indian democratic political system due to adoption of
the parliamentary form of government, also known as
‘Westminster’ model of government1 .
Articles 79 to 122 in Part V of the Constitution deal with the
organisation, composition, duration, officers, procedures,
privileges, powers and so on of the Parliament.
# ORGANISATION OF  PARLIAMENT


Under the Constitution, the Parliament of India consists of three
parts viz, the President, the Council of States and the House of
the People. In 1954, the Hindi names ‘Rajya Sabha’ and ‘Lok
Sabha’ were adopted by the Council of States and the House of
People respectively. The Rajya Sabha is the Upper House
(Second Chamber or House of Elders) and the Lok Sabha is the
Lower House (First Chamber or Popular House). The former
represents the states and union territories of the Indian Union,
while the latter represents the people of India as a whole.
Though the President of India is not a member of either House
of Parliament and does not sit in the Parliament to attend its
meetings, he is an integral part of the Parliament. This is because
a bill passed by both the Houses of Parliament cannot become
law without the President’s assent. He also performs certain
functions relating to the proceedings of the Parliament, for
example, he summons and pro-rogues both the Houses, dissolves
the Lok Sabha, addresses both the Houses, issues ordinances
when they are not in session, and so on.
In this respect, the framers of the Indian Constitution relied on
the British pattern rather than the American pattern. In Britain, the
Parliament consists of the Crown (King or Queen), the House of
Lords (Upper House) and the House of Commons (Lower House).
By contrast, the American president is not an integral part of the
legislature. In USA, the legislature, which is known as Congress,
consists of the Senate (Upper House) and the House of
Representatives (Lower House).
The parliamentary form of government emphasises on the
interdependence between the legislative and executive organs.
Hence, we have the ‘President-in-Parliament’ like the ‘Crown-in-
Parliament’ in Britain. The presidential form of government, on the
other hand, lays stress on the separation of legislative and
executive organs. Hence, the American president is not regarded
as a constituent part of the Congress.
# COMPOSITION OF THE TWO  HOUSES


Composition of Rajya Sabha
The maximum strength of the Rajya Sabha is fixed at 250, out of
which, 238 are to be the representatives of the states and union
territories (elected indirectly) and 12 are nominated by the
president.
At present, the Rajya Sabha has 245 members. Of these, 229
members represent the states, 4 members represent the union
territories and 12 members are nominated by the president.
The Fourth Schedule of the Constitution deals with the
allocation of seats in the Rajya Sabha to the states and union
territories2 .
1. Representation of States
The representatives of states in the Rajya Sabha are elected by
the elected members of state legislative assemblies. The election
is held in accordance with the system of proportional
representation by means of the single transferable vote. The seats
are allotted to the states in the Rajya Sabha on the basis of
population. Hence, the number of representatives varies from
state to state. For example, Uttar Pradesh has 31 members while
Tripura has 1 member only. However, in USA, all states are given
equal representation in the Senate irrespective of their population.
USA has 50 states and the Senate has 100 members–2 from
each state.
2. Representation of Union Territories
The representatives of each union territory in the Rajya Sabha are
indirectly elected by members of an electoral college specially
constituted for the purpose. This election is also held in
accordance with the system of proportional representation by
means of the single transferable vote. Out of the nine union
territories, only three (Delhi, Puducherry and Jammu & Kashmir)
have representation in Rajya Sabha. The populations of other six
union territories are too small to have any representative in the
Rajya Sabha.
3. Nominated Members
The president nominates 12 members to the Rajya Sabha from
people who have special knowledge or practical experience in art,
literature, science and social service. The rationale behind this
principle of nomination is to provide eminent persons a place in
the Rajya Sabha without going through the process of election. It
should be noted here that the American Senate has no nominated
members.
Composition of Lok Sabha
The maximum strength of the Lok Sabha is fixed at 552. Out of
this, 530 members are to be the representatives of the states, 20
members are to be the representatives of the union territories and
2 members are to be nominated by the president from the Anglo-
Indian community3 .
At present, the Lok Sabha has 545 members. Of these, 530
members represent the states, 13 members represent the union
territories and 2 Anglo-Indian members are nominated by the
President4 .
1. Representation of States
The representatives of states in the Lok Sabha are directly elected
by the people from the territorial constituencies in the states. The
election is based on the principle of universal adult franchise.
Every Indian citizen who is above 18 years of age and who is not
disqualified under the provisions of the Constitution or any law is
eligible to vote at such election. The voting age was reduced from
21 to 18 years by the 61st Constitutional Amendment Act, 1988.
2. Representation of Union Territories
The Constitution has empowered the Parliament to prescribe the
manner of choosing the representatives of the union territories in
the Lok Sabha. Accordingly, the Parliament has enacted the
Union Territories (Direct Election to the House of the People) Act,
1965, by which the members of Lok Sabha from the union
territories are also chosen by direct election.
3. Nominated Members
The president can nominate two members from the Anglo-Indian
community if the community is not adequately represented in the
Lok Sabha. Originally, this provision was to operate till 1960 but
has been extended till 2020 by the 95th Amendment Act, 2009.
# SYSTEM OF  ELECTIONS TO LOK  SABHA


The various aspects related to the system of elections to the Lok
Sabha are as follows:
Territorial Constituencies
For the purpose of holding direct elections to the Lok Sabha, each
state is divided into territorial constituencies. In this respect, the
Constitution makes the following two provisions:
1. Each state is allotted a number of seats in the Lok Sabha in
such a manner that the ratio between that number and its
population is the same for all states. This provision does not
apply to a state having a population of less than six millions.
2. Each state is divided into territorial constituencies in such a
manner that the ratio between the population of each
constituency and the number of seats allotted to it is the
same throughout the state.
In brief, the Constitution ensures that there is uniformity of
representation in two respects: (a) between the different states,
and b) between the different constituencies in the same state.
The expression ‘population’ means the population as
ascertained at the preceding census of which the relevant figures
have been published.
Readjustment after each Census
After every census, a readjustment is to be made in (a) allocation
of seats in the Lok Sabha to the states, and (b) division of each
state into territorial constituencies. Parliament is empowered to
determine the authority and the manner in which it is to be made.
Accordingly, the Parliament has enacted the Delimitation
Commission Acts in 1952, 1962, 1972 and 2002 for this purpose.
The 42nd Amendment Act of 1976 froze the allocation of seats
in the Lok Sabha to the states and the division of each state into
territorial constituencies till the year 2000 at the 1971 level. This
ban on readjustment was extended for another 25 years (ie, upto
year 2026) by the 84th Amendment Act of 2001, with the same
objective of encouraging population limiting measures.
The 84th Amendment Act of 2001 also empowered the
government to undertake readjustment and rationalisation of
territorial constituencies in the states on the basis of the
population figures of 1991 census. Later, the 87th Amendment Act
of 2003 provided for the delimitation of constituencies on the basis
of 2001 census and not 1991 census. However, this can be done
without altering the number of seats allotted to each state in the
Lok Sabha.
Reservation of Seats for SCs and STs
Though the Constitution has abandoned the system of communal
representation, it provides for the reservation of seats for
scheduled castes and scheduled tribes in the Lok Sabha on the
basis of population ratios5 .
Originally, this reservation was to operate for ten years (ie, up
to 1960), but it has been extended continuously since then by 10
years each time. Now, under the 95th Amendment Act of 2009,
this reservation is to last until 2020.
Though seats are reserved for scheduled castes and scheduled
tribes, they are elected by all the voters in a constituency, without
any separate electorate. A member of scheduled castes and
scheduled tribes is also not debarred from contesting a general
(non-reserved) seat.
The 84th Amendment Act of 2001 provided for refixing of the
reserved seats on the basis of the population figures of 1991
census as applied to rationalisation of the general seats. Later, the
87th Amendment Act of 2003 provided for the refixing of the
reserved seats on the basis of 2001 census and not 1991 census.
First-Past-The-Post System
Though the Constitution has adopted the system of proportional
representation in the case of Rajya Sabha, it has not preferred the
same system in the case of Lok Sabha. Instead, it has adopted
the system of territorial representation (First-past-the-post system)
for the election of members to the Lok Sabha.
Under territorial representation, every member of the legislature
represents a geographical area known as a constituency. From
each constituency, only one representative is elected. Hence such
a constituency is known as single-member constituency. In this
system, a candidate who secures majority of votes is declared
elected. This simple majority system of representation does not
represent the whole electorate. In other words, it does not secure
due representation to minorities (small groups).
The system of proportional representation aims at removing the
defects of territorial representation. Under this system, all sections
of the people get representation in proportion to their number.
Even the smallest section of the population gets its due share of
representation in the legislature.
There are two kinds of proportional representation, namely,
single transferable vote system and list system. In India, the first
kind is adopted for the election of members to the Rajya Sabha
and state legislative council and for electing the President and the
Vice-President.
Though some members of the Constituent Assembly had
advocated the system of proportional representation for the
election of members to the Lok Sabha, the Constitution has not
adopted the system due to two reasons.
1. Difficulty for the voters to understand the system (which is
complicated) due to low literacy scale in the country.
2. Unsuitability to the parliamentary government due to the
tendency of the system to multiply political parties leading to
instability in government.
Additionally, the system of proportional representation has the
following demerits:
1. It is highly expensive.
2. It does not give any scope for organising by-elections.
3. It eliminates intimate contacts between voters and
representatives.
4. It promotes minority thinking and group interests.
5. It increases the significance of party system and decreases
that of voter.
# DURATION OF TWO  HOUSES


Duration of Rajya Sabha
The Rajya Sabha (first constituted in 1952) is a continuing
chamber, that is, it is a permanent body and not subject to
dissolution. However, one-third of its members retire every second
year. Their seats are filled up by fresh elections and presidential
nominations at the beginning of every third year. The retiring
members are eligible for re-election and renomination any number
of times.
The Constitution has not fixed the term of office of members of
the Rajya Sabha and left it to the Parliament. Accordingly, the
Parliament in the Representation of the People Act (1951)
provided that the term of office of a member of the Rajya Sabha
shall be six years. The act also empowered the president of India
to curtail the term of members chosen in the first Rajya Sabha. In
the first batch, it was decided by lottery as to who should retire.
Further, the act also authorised the President to make provisions
to govern the order of retirement of the members of the Rajya
Sabha6 .
Duration of Lok Sabha
Unlike the Rajya Sabha, the Lok Sabha is not a continuing
chamber. Its normal term is five years from the date of its first
meeting after the general elections, after which it automatically
dissolves. However, the President is authorised to dissolve the
Lok Sabha at any time even before the completion of five years
and this cannot be challenged in a court of law.
Further, the term of the Lok Sabha can be extended during the
period of national emergency be a law of Parliament for one year
at a time7 for any length of time. However, this extension cannot
continue beyond a period of six months after the emergency has
ceased to operate.
# MEMBERSHIP OF  PARLIAMENT


Qualifications
The Constitution lays down the following qualifications for a
person to be chosen a member of the Parliament:
1. He must be a citizen of India.
2. He must make and subscribe to an oath or affirmation
before the person authorised by the election commission for
this purpose. In his oath or affirmation, he swears
(a) To bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of
India
(b) To uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India
3. He must be not less than 30 years of age in the case of the
Rajya Sabha and not less than 25 years of age in the case
of the Lok Sabha.
4. He must posses other qualifications prescribed by
Parliament.
The Parliament has laid down the following additional
qualifications in the Representation of People Act (1951).
1. He must be registered as an elector for a parliamentary
constituency. This is same in the case of both, the Rajya
Sabha and the Lok Sabha. The requirement that a candidate
contesting an election to the Rajya Sabha from a particular
state should be an elector in that particular state was
dispensed with in 2003. In 2006, the Supreme Court upheld
the constitutional validity of this change.
2. He must be a member of a scheduled caste or scheduled
tribe in any state or union territory, if he wants to contest a
seat reserved for them. However, a member of scheduled
castes or scheduled tribes can also contest a seat not
reserved for them.
Disqualifications
Under the Constitution, a person shall be disqualified for being
elected as a member of Parliament:
1. if he holds any office of profit under the Union or state
government (except that of a minister or any other office
exempted by Parliament).8
2. if he is of unsound mind and stands so declared by a court.
3. if he is an undischarged insolvent.
4. if he is not a citizen of India or has voluntarily acquired the
citizenship of a foreign state or is under any
acknowledgement of allegiance to a foreign state; and
5. if he is so disqualified under any law made by Parliament.
The Parliament has laid down the following additional
disqualifications in the Representation of People Act (1951):
1. He must not have been found guilty of certain election
offences or corrupt practices in the elections.
2. He must not have been convicted for any offence resulting in
imprisonment for two or more years. But, the detention of a
person under a preventive detention law is not a
disqualification.
3. He must not have failed to lodge an account of his election
expenses within the time.
4. He must not have any interest in government contracts,
works or services.
5. He must not be a director or managing agent nor hold an
office of profit in a corporation in which the government has
at least 25 per cent share.
6. He must not have been dismissed from government service
for corruption or disloyalty to the State.
7. He must not have been convicted for promoting enmity
between different groups or for the offence of bribery.
8. He must not have been punished for preaching and
practising social crimes such as untouchability, dowry and
sati.
On the question whether a member is subject to any of the
above disqualifications, the president’s decision is final. However,
he should obtain the opinion of the election commission and act
accordingly.
Disqualification on Ground of Defection
The Constitution also lays down that a person shall be disqualified
from being a member of Parliament if he is so disqualified on the
ground of defection under the provisions of the Tenth Schedule. A
member incurs disqualification under the defection law:
1. if he voluntary gives up the membership of the political party
on whose ticket he is elected to the House;
2. if he votes or abstains from voting in the House contrary to
any direction given by his political party;
3. if any independently elected member joins any political
party; and
4. if any nominated member joins any political party after the
expiry of six months.
The question of disqualification under the Tenth Schedule is
decided by the Chairman in the case of Rajya Sabha and Speaker
in the case of Lok Sabha (and not by the president of India). In
1992, the Supreme Court ruled that the decision of the Chairman/
Speaker in this regard is subject to judicial review.
Vacating of Seats
In the following cases, a member of Parliament vacates his seat.
1. Double Membership
A person cannot be a member of both Houses of Parliament at
the same time. Thus, the Representation of People Act (1951)
provides for the following:
(a) If a person is elected to both the Houses of Parliament, he
must intimate within 10 days in which House he desires to
serve. In default of such intimation, his seat in the Rajya
Sabha becomes vacant.
(b) If a sitting member of one House is also elected to the other
House, his seat in the first House becomes vacant.
(c) If a person is elected to two seats in a House, he should
exercise his option for one. Otherwise, both seats become
vacant.
Similarly, a person cannot be a member of both the Parliament
and the state legislature at the same time. If a person is so
elected, his seat in Parliament becomes vacant if he does not
resign his seat in the state legislature within 14 days9 .
2. Disqualification
If a member of Parliament becomes subject to any of the
disqualifications specified in the Constitution, his seat becomes
vacant. Here, the list of disqualifications also include the
disqualification on the grounds of defection under the provisions of
the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution.
3. Resignation
A member may resign his seat by writing to the Chairman of Rajya
Sabha or Speaker of Lok Sabha, as the case may be. The seat
falls vacant when the resignation is accepted. However, the
Chairman/ Speaker may not accept the resignation if he is
satisfied that it is not voluntary or genuine.
4. Absence
A House can declare the seat of a member vacant if he is absent
from all its meetings for a period of sixty days without its
permission. In computing the period of sixty days, no account
shall be taken of any period during which the House is prorogued
or adjourned for more than four consecutive days.
5. Other cases
A member has to vacate his seat in the Parliament:
(a) if his election is declared void by the court;
(b) if he is expelled by the House;
(c) if he is elected to the office of President or Vice-President;
and
(d) if he is appointed to the office of governor of a state.
If a disqualified person is elected to the Parliament, the
Constitution lays down no procedure to declare the election void.
This matter is dealt by the Representation of the People Act
(1951), which enables the high court to declare an election void if
a disqualified candidate is elected. The aggrieved party can
appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the high court in
this regard.
Oath or Affirmation
Every member of either House of Parliament, before taking his
seat in the House, has to make and subscribe to an oath or
affirmation before the President or some person appointed by him
for this purpose. In his oath or affirmation, a member of Parliament
swears:
1. to bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India;
2. to uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India; and
3. to faithfully discharge the duty upon which he is about to
enter.
Unless a member takes the oath, he cannot vote and
participate in the proceedings of the House and does not become
eligible to parliamentary privileges and immunities.
A person is liable to a penalty of ₹500 for each day he sits or
votes as a member in a House in the following conditions:
1. Before taking and subscribing to the prescribed oath or
affirmation; or
2. When he knows that he is not qualified or that he is
disqualified for its membership; or
3. When he knows that he is prohibited from sitting or voting in
the House by virtue of any parliamentary law.
Salaries and Allowances
Members of either House of Parliament are entitled to receive
such salaries and allowances as may be determined by
Parliament, and there is no provision of pension in the
Constitution. However, Parliament has provided pension to the
members.
In 1954, the Parliament enacted the Salaries, Allowances and
Pension of Members of Parliament Act. In 2018, the salary of
members was increased from ₹50,000 to ₹1,00,000 per month,
the constituency allowance from ₹45,000 to ₹70,000 per month
and the office expenses allowance from ₹45,000 to ₹60,000 per
month. Earlier in 2010, the daily allowance was increased from
₹1,000 to ₹2,000 for each day of residence on duty.
From 1976, the members are also entitled to a pension on a
graduated scale for each five-year-term as members of either
House of Parliament. Besides, they are provided with travelling
facilities, free accommodation, telephone, vehicle advance,
medical facilities and so on.
The salaries and allowances of the Speaker and Deputy
Speaker of Lok Sabha and the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of
Rajya Sabha are also determined by Parliament. They are
charged on the Consolidated Fund of India and thus are not
subject to the annual vote of Parliament.
In 1953, the Parliament enacted the Salaries and Allowances of
Officers of Parliament Act. Under this Act, “Officer of Parliament”
means any of the following officers, namely, the Chairman and
Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha and the Speaker and the
Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha. In 2018, the Parliament
increased the salary of the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha from
₹1.25 lakh to ₹4 lakh per month9a. Similarly, other Officers of
Parliament (i.e., the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker of the Lok
Sabha and the Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha) are entitled
to receive a salary per month at the same rates as are payable to
the Members of Parliament.9b Further, each Officer of Parliament
(other than the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha) is entitled to receive
a daily allowance (for each day during the whole of his term) at
the same rate as is payable to the Members of Parliament.9c Also,
each Officer of Parliament (other than the Chairman of the Rajya
Sabha) is entitled to receive a constituency allowance at the same
rate as is payable to the Members of Parliament.9d
According to the same Act, the sumptuary allowance is paid to
the Speaker of the Lok Sabha at the same rate as is payable to a
Cabinet Minister9e (i.e., ₹2,000 per month). Likewise, the
sumptuary allowance is paid to the Deputy Speaker of the Lok
Sabha and the Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha at the same
rate as is payable to a Minister of State9f (i.e., ₹1000 per month).
# PRESIDING  OFFICERS OF  PARLIAMENT


Each House of Parliament has its own presiding officer. There is a
Speaker and a Deputy Speaker for the Lok Sabha and a
Chairman and a Deputy Chairman for the Rajya Sabha. A panel of
chairpersons for the Lok Sabha and a panel of vice-chairpersons
for the Rajya Sabha is also appointed.
Speaker of Lok Sabha
Election and Tenure
The Speaker is elected by the Lok Sabha from amongst its
members (as soon as may be, after its first sitting). Whenever the
office of the Speaker falls vacant, the Lok Sabha elects another
member to fill the vacancy. The date of election of the Speaker is
fixed by the President.
Usually, the Speaker remains in office during the life of the Lok
Sabha. However, he has to vacate his office earlier in any of the
following three cases:
1. if he ceases to be a member of the Lok Sabha;
2. if he resigns by writing to the Deputy Speaker; and
3. if he is removed by a resolution passed by a majority of all
then members of the Lok Sabha. Such a resolution can be
moved only after giving 14 days’ advance notice.
When a resolution for the removal of the Speaker is under
consideration of the House, he cannot preside at the sitting of the
House, though he may be present. However, he can speak and
take part in the proceedings of the House at such a time and vote
in the first instance, though not in the case of an equality of votes.
It should be noted here that, whenever the Lok Sabha is
dissolved, the Speaker does not vacate his office and continues
till the newly-elected Lok Sabha meets.
Role, Powers and Functions
The Speaker is the head of the Lok Sabha, and its representative.
He is the guardian of powers and privileges of the members, the
House as a whole and its committees. He is the principal
spokesman of the House, and his decision in all Parliamentary
matters is final. He is thus much more than merely the presiding
officer of the Lok Sabha. In these capacities, he is vested with
vast, varied and vital responsibilities and enjoys great honour,
high dignity and supreme authority within the House.
The Speaker of the Lok Sabha derives his powers and duties
from three sources, that is, the Constitution of India, the Rules of
Procedure and Conduct of Business of Lok Sabha, and
Parliamentary Conventions (residuary powers that are unwritten
or unspecified in the Rules). Altogether, he has the following
powers and duties:
1. He maintains order and decorum in the House for
conducting its business and regulating its proceedings. This
is his primary responsibility and he has final power in this
regard.
2. He is the final interpreter of the provisions of (a) the
Constitution of India, (b) the Rules of Procedure and
Conduct of Business of Lok Sabha, and (c) the
parliamentary precedents, within the House.
3. He adjourns the House or suspends the meeting in absence
of a quorum. The quorum to constitute a meeting of the
House is one-tenth of the total strength of the House.
4. He does not vote in the first instance. But he can exercise a
casting vote in the case of a tie. In other words, only when
the House is divided equally on any question, the Speaker is
entitled to vote. Such vote is called casting vote, and its
purpose is to resolve a deadlock.
5. He presides over a joint setting of the two Houses of
Parliament. Such a sitting is summoned by the President to
settle a deadlock between the two Houses on a bill.
6. He can allow a ‘secret’ sitting of the House at the request of
the Leader of the House. When the House sits in secret, no
stranger can be present in the chamber, lobby or galleries
except with the permission of the Speaker.
7. He decides whether a bill is a money bill or not and his
decision on this question is final. When a money bill is
transmitted to the Rajya Sabha for recommendation and
presented to the President for assent, the Speaker endorses
on the bill his certificate that it is a money bill.
8. He decides the questions of disqualification of a member of
the Lok Sabha, arising on the ground of defection under the
provisions of the Tenth Schedule. In 1992, the Supreme
Court ruled that the decision of the Speaker in this regard is
subject to judicial review10 .
9. He acts as the ex-officio chairman of the Indian
Parliamentary Group which is a link between the Parliament
of India and the various parliaments of the world. He also
acts as the ex-officio chairman of the conference of
presiding officers of legislative bodies in the country.
10. He appoints the chairman of all the parliamentary
committees of the Lok Sabha and supervises their
functioning. He himself is the chairman of the Business
Advisory Committee, the Rules Committee and the General
Purpose Committee.
Independence and Impartiality
As the office of the Speaker is vested with great prestige, position
and authority, independence and impartiality becomes its sine qua
non11 .
The following provisions ensure the independence and
impartiality of the office of the Speaker:
1. He is provided with a security of tenure. He can be removed
only by a resolution passed by the Lok Sabha by a special
majority (ie, a majority of all the then members of the House)
and not by an ordinary majority (ie, a majority of the
members present and voting in the House). This motion of
removal can be considered and discussed only when it has
the support of at least 50 members.
2. His salaries and allowances are fixed by Parliament. They
are charged on the Consolidated Fund of India and thus are
not subject to the annual vote of Parliament.
3. His work and conduct cannot be discussed and criticised in
the Lok Sabha except on a substantive motion.
4. His powers of regulating procedure or conducting business
or maintaining order in the House are not subject to the
jurisdiction of any Court.
5. He cannot vote in the first instance. He can only exercise a
casting vote in the event of a tie. This makes the position of
Speaker impartial.
6. He is given a very high position in the order of precedence.
He is placed at seventh rank, along with the Chief Justice of
India. This means, he has a higher rank than all cabinet
ministers, except the Prime Minister or Deputy Prime
Minister.
In Britain, the Speaker is strictly a nonparty man. There is a
convention that the Speaker has to resign from his party and
remain politically neutral. This healthy convention is not fully
established in India where the Speaker does not resign from the
membership of his party on his election to the exalted office.
Deputy Speaker of Lok Sabha
Like the Speaker, the Deputy Speaker is also elected by the Lok
Sabha itself from amongst its members. He is elected after the
election of the Speaker has taken place. The date of election of
the Deputy Speaker is fixed by the Speaker. Whenever the office
of the Deputy Speaker falls vacant, the Lok Sabha elects another
member to fill the vacancy.
Like the Speaker, the Deputy Speaker remains in office usually
during the life of the Lok Sabha. However, he may vacate his
office earlier in any of the following three cases:
1. if he ceases to be a member of the Lok Sabha;
2. if he resigns by writing to the Speaker; and
3. if he is removed by a resolution passed by a majority of all
the then members of the Lok Sabha. Such a resolution can
be moved only after giving 14 days’ advance notice.
The Deputy Speaker performs the duties of the Speaker’s office
when it is vacant. He also acts as the Speaker when the latter is
absent from the sitting of the House. In both the cases, he
assumes all the powers of the Speaker. He also presides over the
joint sitting of both the Houses of Parliament, in case the Speaker
is absent from such a sitting.
It should be noted here that the Deputy Speaker is not
subordinate to the Speaker. He is directly responsible to the
House.
The Deputy Speaker has one special privilege, that is,
whenever he is appointed as a member of a parliamentary
committee, he automatically becomes its chairman.
Like the Speaker, the Deputy Speaker, while presiding over the
House, cannot vote in the first instance; he can only exercise a
casting vote in the case of a tie. Further, when a resolution for the
removal of the Deputy Speaker is under consideration of the
House, he cannot preside at the sitting of the House, though he
may be present.
When the Speaker presides over the House, the Deputy
Speaker is like any other ordinary member of the House. He can
speak in the House, participate in its proceedings and vote on any
question before the House.
The Deputy Speaker is entitled to a regular salary and
allowance fixed by Parliament, and charged on the Consolidated
Fund of India.
Upto the 10th Lok Sabha, both the Speaker and the Deputy
Speaker were usually from the ruling party. Since the 11th Lok
Sabha, there has been a consensus that the Speaker comes from
the ruling party (or ruling alliance) and the post of Deputy Speaker
goes to the main opposition party.
The Speaker and the Deputy Speaker, while assuming their
offices, do not make and subscribe any separate oath or
affirmation.
The institutions of Speaker and Deputy Speaker originated in
India in 1921 under the provisions of the Government of India Act
of 1919 (Montague-Chelmsford Reforms). At that time, the
Speaker and the Deputy Speaker were called the President and
Deputy President respectively and the same nomenclature
continued till 1947. Before 1921, the Governor-General of India
used to preside over the meetings of the Central Legislative
Council. In 1921, the Frederick Whyte and Sachidanand Sinha
were appointed by the Governor-General of India as the first
Speaker and the first Deputy Speaker (respectively) of the central
legislative assembly. In 1925, Vithalbhai J. Patel became the first
Indian and the first elected Speaker of the central legislative
assembly. The Government of India Act of 1935 changed the
nomenclatures of President and Deputy President of the Central
Legislative Assembly to the Speaker and Deputy Speaker
respectively. However, the old nomenclature continued till 1947 as
the federal part of the 1935 Act was not implemented. G.V.
Mavalankar and Ananthasayanam Ayyangar had the distinction of
being the first Speaker and the first Deputy Speaker (respectively)
of the Lok Sabha. G.V. Mavalankar also held the post of Speaker
in the Constituent Assembly (Legislative) as well as the
provisional Parliament. He held the post of Speaker of Lok Sabha
continuously for one decade from 1946 to 1956.
Panel of Chairpersons of Lok Sabha
Under the Rules of Lok Sabha, the Speaker nominates from
amongst the members a panel of not more than ten chairpersons.
Any of them can preside over the House in the absence of the
Speaker or the Deputy Speaker. He has the same powers as the
Speaker when so presiding. He holds office until a new panel of
chairpersons is nominated. When a member of the panel of
chairpersons is also not present, any other person as determined
by House acts as the Speaker.
It must be emphasised here that a member of the panel of
chairpersons cannot preside over the House, when the office of
the Speaker or the Deputy Speaker is vacant. During such time,
the Speaker’s duties are to be performed by such member of the
House as the President may appoint for the purpose. The
elections are held, as soon as possible, to fill the vacant posts.
Speaker Pro Tem
As provided by the Constitution, the Speaker of the last Lok
Sabha vacates his office immediately before the first meeting of
the newly-elected Lok Sabha. Therefore, the President appoints a
member of the Lok Sabha as the Speaker Pro Tem. Usually, the
seniormost member is selected for this. The President himself
administers oath to the Speaker Pro Tem.
The Speaker Pro Tem has all the powers of the Speaker. He
presides over the first sitting of the newly-elected Lok Sabha. His
main duty is to administer oath to the new members. He also
enables the House to elect the new Speaker.
When the new Speaker is elected by the House, the office of
the Speaker Pro Tem ceases to exist. Hence, this office is a
temporary office, existing for a few days12 .
Chairman of Rajya Sabha
The presiding officer of the Rajya Sabha is known as the
Chairman. The vice-president of India is the ex-officio Chairman of
the Rajya Sabha. During any period when the VicePresident acts
as President or discharges the functions of the President, he does
not perform the duties of the office of the Chairman of Rajya
Sabha.
The Chairman of the Rajya Sabha can be removed from his
office only if he is removed from the office of the Vice-President.
As a presiding officer, the powers and functions of the Chairman
in the Rajya Sabha are similar to those of the Speaker in the Lok
Sabha. However, the Speaker has two special powers which are
not enjoyed by the Chairman:
1. The Speaker decides whether a bill is a money bill or not
and his decision on this question is final.
2. The Speaker presides over a joint sitting of two Houses of
Parliament.
Unlike the Speaker (who is a member of the House), the
Chairman is not a member of the House. But like the Speaker, the
Chairman also cannot vote in the first instance. He too can cast a
vote in the case of an equality of votes.
The Vice-President cannot preside over a sitting of the Rajya
Sabha as its Chairman when a resolution for his removal is under
consideration. However, he can be present and speak in the
House and can take part in its proceedings, without voting, even
at such a time (while the Speaker can vote in the first instance
when a resolution for his removal is under consideration of the
Lok Sabha).
As in case of the Speaker, the salaries and allowances of the
Chairman are also fixed by the Parliament. They are charged on
the Consolidated Fund of India and thus are not subject to the
annual vote of Parliament.
During any period when the Vice-President acts as President or
discharges the functions of the President, he is not entitled to any
salary or allowance payable to the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha.
But he is paid the salary and allowance of the President during
such a time.
Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha
The Deputy Chairman is elected by the Rajya Sabha itself from
amongst its members. Whenever the office of the Deputy
Chairman falls vacant, the Rajya Sabha elects another member to
fill the vacancy.
The Deputy Chairman vacates his office in any of the following
three cases:
1. if he ceases to be a member of the Rajya Sabha;
2. if he resigns by writing to the Chairman; and
3. if he is removed by a resolution passed by a majority of all
the then members of the Rajya Sabha. Such a resolution
can be moved only after giving 14 days’ advance notice.
The Deputy Chairman performs the duties of the Chairman’s
office when it is vacant or when the Vice-President acts as
President or discharges the functions of the President. He also
acts as the Chairman when the latter is absent from the sitting of
the House. In both the cases, he has all the powers of the
Chairman.
It should be emphasised here that the Deputy Chairman is not
subordinate to the Chairman. He is directly responsible to the
Rajya Sabha.
Like the Chairman, the Deputy Chairman, while presiding over
the House, cannot vote in the first instance; he can only exercise
a casting vote in the case of a tie. Further, when a resolution for
the removal of the Deputy Chairman is under consideration of the
House, he cannot preside over a sitting of the House, though he
may be present.
When the Chairman presides over the House, the Deputy
Chairman is like any other ordinary member of the House. He can
speak in the House, participate in its proceedings and vote on any
question before the House.
Like the Chairman, the Deputy Chairman is also entitled to a
regular salary and allowance. They are fixed by Parliament and
are charged on the Consolidated Fund of India.
Panel of Vice-Chairpersons of Rajya Sabha
Under the Rules of Rajya Sabha, the Chairman nominates from
amongst the members a panel of vice-chairpersons. Any one of
them can preside over the House in the absence of the Chairman
or the Deputy Chairman. He has the same powers as the
Chairman when so presiding. He holds office until a new panel of
vice-chairpersons is nominated.
When a member of the panel of vicechairpersons is also not
present, any other person as determined by the House acts as the
Chairman.
It must be emphasised here that a member of the panel of vicechairpersons
cannot preside over the House, when the office of
the Chairman or the Deputy Chairman is vacant. During such
time, the Chairman’s duties are to be performed by such member
of the House as the president may appoint for the purpose. The
elections are held, as soon as possible, to fill the vacant posts.
Secretariat of Parliament
Each House of Parliament has separate secretarial staff of its
own, though there can be some posts common to both the
Houses. Their recruitment and service conditions are regulated by
Parliament. The secretariat of each House is headed by a
secretary-general. He is a permanent officer and is appointed by
the presiding officer of the House.
# LEADERS IN  PARLIAMENT


Leader of the House
Under the Rules of Lok Sabha, the ‘Leader of the House’ means
the prime minister, if he is a member of the Lok Sabha, or a
minister who is a member of the Lok Sabha and is nominated by
the prime minister to function as the Leader of the House. There is
also a ‘Leader of the House’ in the Rajya Sabha. He is a minister
and a member of the Rajya Sabha and is nominated by the prime
minister to function as such. The leader of the house in either
House is an important functionary and exercises direct influence
on the conduct of business. He can also nominate a deputy leader
of the House. The same functionary in USA is known as the
‘majority leader’.
Leader of the Opposition
In each House of Parliament, there is the ‘Leader of the
Opposition’. The leader of the largest Opposition party having not
less than one-tenth seats of the total strength of the House is
recognised as the leader of the Opposition in that House. In a
parliamentary system of government, the leader of the opposition
has a significant role to play. His main functions are to provide a
constructive criticism of the policies of the government and to
provide an alternative government. Therefore, the leader of
Opposition in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha were accorded
statutory recognition in 1977. They are also entitled to the salary,
allowances and other facilities equivalent to that of a cabinet
minister. It was in 1969 that an official leader of the opposition was
recognised for the first time. The same functionary in USA is
known as the ‘minority leader’.
The British political system has an unique institution called the
‘Shadow Cabinet’. It is formed by the Opposition party to balance
the ruling cabinet and to prepare its members for future ministerial
offices. In this shadow cabinet, almost every member in the ruling
cabinet is ‘shadowed’ by a corresponding member in the
opposition cabinet. This shadow cabinet serves as the ‘alternate
cabinet’ if there is change of government. That is why Ivor
Jennings described the leader of Opposition as the ‘alternative
Prime Minister’. He enjoys the status of a minister and is paid by
the government.
Whip
Though the offices of the leader of the House and the leader of
the Opposition are not mentioned in the Constitution of India, they
are mentioned in the Rules of the House and Parliamentary
Statute respectively. The office of ‘whip’, on the other hand, is
mentioned neither in the Constitution of India nor in the Rules of
the House nor in a Parliamentary Statute. It is based on the
conventions of the parliamentary government.
Every political party, whether ruling or Opposition has its own
whip in the Parliament. He is appointed by the political party to
serve as an assistant floor leader. He is charged with the
responsibility of ensuring the attendance of his party members in
large numbers and securing their support in favour of or against a
particular issue. He regulates and monitors their behaviour in the
Parliament. The members are supposed to follow the directives
given by the whip. Otherwise, disciplinary action can be taken.
# SESSIONS OF  PARLIAMENT


Summoning
The president from time to time summons each House of
Parliament to meet. But, the maximum gap between two sessions
of Parliament cannot be more than six months. In other words, the
Parliament should meet at least twice ayear. There are usually
three sessions in a year, viz,
1. the Budget Session (February to May);
2. the Monsoon Session (July to September); and
3. the Winter Session (November to December).
A ‘session’ of Parliament is the period spanning between the
first sitting of a House and its prorogation (or dissolution in the
case of the Lok Sabha). During a session, the House meets
everyday to transact business. The period spanning between the
prorogation of a House and its reassembly in a new session is
called ‘recess’.
Adjournment
A session of Parliament consists of many meetings. Each meeting
of a day consists of two sittings, that is, a morning sitting from 11
am to 1 pm and post-lunch sitting from 2 pm to 6 pm. A sitting of
Parliament can be terminated by adjournment or adjournment sine
die or prorogation or dissolution (in the case of the Lok Sabha).
An adjournment suspends the work in a sitting for a specified
time, which may be hours, days or weeks.
Adjournment Sine Die
Adjournment sine die means terminating a sitting of Parliament for
an indefinite period. In other words, when the House is adjourned
without naming a day for reassembly, it is called adjournment sine
die. The power of adjournment as well as adjournment sine die
lies with the presiding officer of the House. He can also call a
sitting of the House before the date or time to which it has been
adjourned or at any time after the House has been adjourned sine
die.
Prorogation
The presiding officer (Speaker or Chairman) declares the House
adjourned sine die, when the business of a session is completed.
Within the next few days, the President issues a notification for
prorogation of the session. However, the President can also
prorogue the House while in session.
The specific differences between adjournment and prorogation
are summarised in Table 22.1.
Dissolution
Rajya Sabha, being a permanent House, is not subject to
dissolution. Only the Lok Sabha is subject to dissolution. Unlike a
prorogation, a dissolution ends the very life of the existing House,
and a new House is constituted after general elections are held.
The dissolution of the Lok Sabha may take place in either of two
ways:
1. Automatic dissolution, that is, on the expiry of its tenure of
five years or the terms as extended during a national
emergency; or
2. Whenever the President decides to dissolve the House,
which he is authorised to do. Once the Lok Sabha is
dissolved before the completion of its normal tenure, the
dissolution is irrevocable.
When the Lok Sabha is dissolved, all business including bills,
motions, resolutions, notices, petitions and so on pending before it
or its committees lapse. They (to be pursued further) must be
reintroduced in the newly-constituted Lok Sabha. However, some
pending bills and all pending assurances that are to be examined
by the Committee on Government Assurances do not lapse on the
dissolution of the Lok Sabha. The position with respect to lapsing
of bills is as follows:
1. A bill pending in the Lok Sabha lapses (whether originating
in the Lok Sabha or transmitted to it by the Rajya Sabha).
2. A bill passed by the Lok Sabha but pending in the Rajya
Sabha lapses.
3. A bill not passed by the two Houses due to disagreement
and if the president has notified the holding of a joint sitting
before the dissolution of Lok Sabha, does not lapse.
4. A bill pending in the Rajya Sabha but not passed by the Lok
Sabha does not lapse.
5. A bill passed by both Houses but pending assent of the
president does not lapse.
6. A bill passed by both Houses but returned by the president
for reconsideration of Houses does not lapse.

Quorum
Quorum is the minimum number of members required to be
present in the House before it can transact any business. It is onetenth
of the total number of members in each House including the
presiding officer. It means that there must be at least 55 members
present in the Lok Sabha and 25 members present in the Rajya
Sabha, if any business is to be conducted. If there is no quorum
during a meeting of the House, it is the duty of the presiding
officer either to adjourn the House or to suspend the meeting until
there is a quorum.
Voting in House
All matters at any sitting of either House or joint sitting of both the
Houses are decided by a majority of votes of the members
present and voting, excluding the presiding officer. Only a few
matters, which are specifically mentioned in the Constitution like
impeachment of the President, amendment of the Constitution,
removal of the presiding officers of the Parliament and so on,
require special majority, not ordinary majority.
The presiding officer of a House does not vote in the first
instance, but exercises a casting vote in the case of an equality of
votes. The proceedings of a House are to be valid irrespective of
any unauthorised voting or participation or any vacancy in its
membership.
The following points can be noted with respect to the voting
procedure in the Lok Sabha:
1. On the conclusion of a debate, the Speaker shall put the
question and invite those who are in favour of the motion to
say ‘Aye’ and those against the motion to say ‘No’.
2. The Speaker shall then say: ‘I think the Ayes (or the Noes,
as the case may be) have it.’ If the opinion of the Speaker as
to the decision of a question is not challenged, he shall say
twice: The Ayes (or the Noes, as the case may be) have it’
and the question before the House shall be determined
accordingly.
3. (a) If the opinion of the Speaker as to the decision of a
question is challenged, he shall order that the Lobby be
cleared.
(b) After the lapse of three minutes and thirty seconds, he
shall put the question a second time and declare
whether in his opinion the ‘Ayes’ or the ‘Noes’ have it.
(c) If the opinion so declared is again challenged, he shall
direct that the votes be recorded either by operating the
automatic vote recorder or by using ‘Aye’ and ‘No’ Slips
in the House or by the Members going into the Lobbies.
4. If in the opinion of the Speaker, the Division is unnecessarily
claimed, he may ask the members who are for ‘Aye’ and
those for ‘No’ respectively to rise in their places and, on a
count being taken, he may declare the determination of the
House. In such a case, the names of the voters shall not be
recorded.
Language in Parliament
The Constitution has declared Hindi and English to be the
languages for transacting business in the Parliament. However,
the presiding officer can permit a member to address the House in
his mother-tongue. In both the Houses, arrangements are made
for simultaneous translation. Though English was to be
discontinued as a floor language after the expiration of fifteen
years from the commencement of the Constitution (that is, in
1965), the Official Languages Act (1963) allowed English to be
continued along with Hindi.
Rights of Ministers and Attorney General
In addition to the members of a House, every minister and the
attorney general of India have the right to speak and take part in
the proceedings of either House, any joint sitting of both the
Houses and any committee of Parliament of which he is a
member, without being entitled to vote. There are two reasons
underlying this constitutional provision:
1. A minister can participate in the proceedings of a House, of
which he is not a member. In other words, a minister
belonging to the Lok Sabha can participate in the
proceedings of the Rajya Sabha and vice-versa.
2. A minister, who is not a member of either House, can
participate in the proceedings of both the Houses. It should
be noted here that a person can remain a minister for six
months, without being a member of either House of
Parliament.
Lame-duck Session
It refers to the last session of the existing Lok Sabha, after a new
Lok Sabha has been elected. Those members of the existing Lok
Sabha who could not get re-elected to the new Lok Sabha are
called lame-ducks.
# DEVICES OF  PARLIAMENTARY  PROCEEDINGS


Question Hour
The first hour of every parliamentary sitting is slotted for this.
During this time, the members ask questions and the ministers
usually give answers. The questions are of three kinds, namely,
starred, unstarred and short notice.
A starred question (distinguished by an asterisk) requires an
oral answer and hence supplementary questions can follow.
An unstarred question, on the other hand, requires a written
answer and hence, supplementary questions cannot follow.
A short notice question is one that is asked by giving a notice
of less than ten days. It is answered orally.
In addition to the ministers, the questions can also be asked to
the private members. Thus, a question may be addressed to a
private member if the subject matter of the question relates to
some Bill, resolution or other matter connected with the business
of the House for which that member is responsible. The procedure
in regard to such question is the same as that followed in the case
of questions addressed to a minister.
The list of starred, unstarred, short notice questions and
questions to private members are printed in green, white, light
pink and yellow colour, respectively, to distinguish them from one
another.
Zero Hour
Unlike the question hour, the zero hour is not mentioned in the
Rules of Procedure. Thus it is an informal device available to the
members of the Parliament to raise matters without any prior
notice. The zero hour starts immediately after the question hour
and lasts until the agenda for the day (ie, regular business of the
House) is taken up. In other words, the time gap between the
question hour and the agenda is known as zero hour. It is an
Indian innovation in the field of parliamentary procedures and has
been in existence since 1962.
Motions
No discussion on a matter of general public importance can take
place except on a motion made with the consent of the presiding
officer. The House expresses its decisions or opinions on various
issues through the adoption or rejection of motions moved by
either ministers or private members.
The motions moved by the members to raise discussions on
various matters fall into three principal categories:14
1. Substantive Motion: It is a self-contained independent
proposal dealing with a very important matter like
impeachment of the President or removal of Chief Election
Commissioner.
2. Substitute Motion: It is a motion that is moved in substitution
of an original motion and proposes an alternative to it. If
adopted by the House, it supersedes the original motion.
3. Subsidiary Motion: It is a motion that, by itself, has no
meaning and cannot state the decision of the House without
reference to the original motion or proceedings of the House.
It is divided into three sub-categories:
(a) Ancillary Motion: It is used as the regular way of
proceeding with various kinds of business.
(b) Superseding Motion: It is moved in the course of debate
on another issue and seeks to supersede that issue.
(c) Amendment: It seeks to modify or substitute only a part
of the original motion.
Closure Motion
It is a motion moved by a member to cut short the debate on a
matter before the House. If the motion is approved by the House,
debate is stopped forthwith and the matter is put to vote. There
are four kinds of closure motions15 :
(a) Simple Closure: It is one when a member moves that the
‘matter having been sufficiently discussed be now put to
vote’.
(b) Closure by Compartments: In this case, the clauses of a bill
or a lengthy resolution are grouped into parts before the
commencement of the debate. The debate covers the part as
a whole and the entire part is put to vote.
(c) Kangaroo Closure: Under this type, only important clauses
are taken up for debate and voting and the intervening
clauses are skipped over and taken as passed.
(d) Guillotine Closure: It is one when the undiscussed clauses of
a bill or a resolution are also put to vote along with the
discussed ones due to want of time (as the time allotted for
the discussion is over).
Privilege Motion
It is concerned with the breach of parliamentary privileges by a
minister. It is moved by a member when he feels that a minister
has committed a breach of privilege of the House or one or more
of its members by withholding facts of a case or by giving wrong
or distorted facts. Its purpose is to censure the concerned
minister.
Calling Attention Motion
It is introduced in the Parliament by a member to call the attention
of a minister to a matter of urgent public importance, and to seek
an authoritative statement from him on that matter. Like the zero
hour, it is also an Indian innovation in the parliamentary procedure
and has been in existence since 1954. However, unlike the zero
hour, it is mentioned in the Rules of Procedure.
Adjournment Motion
It is introduced in the Parliament to draw attention of the House to
a definite matter of urgent public importance, and needs the
support of 50 members to be admitted. As it interrupts the normal
business of the House, it is regarded as an extraordinary device. It
involves an element of censure against the government and
hence Rajya Sabha is not permitted to make use of this device.
The discussion on an adjournment motion should last for not less
than two hours and thirty minutes.
The right to move a motion for an adjournment of the business
of the House is subject to the following restrictions:
1. It should raise a matter which is definite, factual, urgent and
of public importance;
2. It should not cover more than one matter;
3. It should be restricted to a specific matter of recent
occurrence and should not be framed in general terms;
4. It should not raise a question of privilege;
5. It should not revive discussion on a matter that has been
discussed in the same session;
6. It should not deal with any matter that is under adjudication
by court; and
7. It should not raise any question that can be raised on a
distinct motion.
No-Confidence Motion
Article 75 of the Constitution says that the council of ministers
shall be collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha. It means that
the ministry stays in office so long as it enjoys confidence of the
majority of the members of the Lok Sabha. In other words, the Lok
Sabha can remove the ministry from office by passing a noconfidence
motion. The motion needs the support of 50 members
to be admitted.
Confidence Motion
The motion of confidence has come up as a new procedural
device to cope with the emerging situations of fractured mandates
resulting in hung parliament, minority governments and coalition
governments. The governments formed with wafer-thin majority
have been called upon by the President to prove their majority on
the floor of the House. The government of the day, sometimes, on
its own, seeks to prove its majority by moving a motion of
confidence and winning the confidence of the House. If the
confidence motion is negatived, it results in the fall of the
government15a.
Censure Motion
A censure motion is different from a no-confidence motion as
shown in Table 22.2.
Motion of Thanks
The first session after each general election and the first session
of every fiscal year is addressed by the president. In this address,
the president outlines the policies and programmes of the
government in the preceding year and ensuing year. This address
of the president, which corresponds to the ‘speech from the
Throne in Britain’, is discussed in both the Houses of Parliament
on a motion called the ‘Motion of Thanks’. At the end of the
discussion, the motion is put to vote. This motion must be passed
in the House. Otherwise, it amounts to the defeat of the
government. This inaugural speech of the president is an
occasion available to the members of Parliament to raise
discussions and debates to examine and criticise the government
and administration for its lapses and failures.
No-Day-Yet-Named Motion
It is a motion that has been admitted by the Speaker but no date
has been fixed for its discussion. The Speaker, after considering
the state of business in the House and in consultation with the
leader of the House or on the recommendation of the Business
Advisory Committee, allots a day or days or part of a day for the
discussion of such a motion.
Dilatory Motion
It is a motion for the adjournment of the debate on a bill / motion /
resolution etc. or a motion to retard or delay the progress of a
business under consideration of the House. It can be moved by a
member at any time after a motion has been made. The debate
on a dilatory motion must be restricted to the matter contained in
such motion. If the Speaker is of the opinion that such a motion is
an abuse of the rules of the House, he may either forthwith put the
question thereon or decline to propose the question.
Point of Order
A member can raise a point of order when the proceedings of the
House do not follow the normal rules of procedure. A point of
order should relate to the interpretation or enforcement of the
Rules of the House or such articles of the Constitution that
regulate the business of the House and should raise a question
that is within the cognizance of the Speaker. It is usually raised by
an opposition member in order to control the government. It is an
extraordinary device as it suspends the proceedings before the
House. No debate is allowed on a point of order.

Half-an-Hour Discussion
It is meant for discussing a matter of sufficient public importance,
which has been subjected to a lot of debate and the answer to
which needs elucidation on a matter of fact. The Speaker can allot
three days in a week for such discussions. There is no formal
motion or voting before the House.
Short Duration Discussion
It is also known as two-hour discussion as the time allotted for
such a discussion should not exceed two hours. The members of
the Parliament can raise such discussions on a matter of urgent
public importance. The Speaker can allot two days in a week for
such discussions. There is neither a formal motion before the
house nor voting. This device has been in existence since 1953.
Special Mention
A matter which is not a point of order or which cannot be raised
during question hour, half-an hour discussion, short duration
discussion or under adjournment motion, calling attention notice
or under any rule of the House can be raised under the special
mention in the Rajya Sabha. Its equivalent procedural device in
the Lok Sabha is known as ‘Notice (Mention) Under Rule 377’.
Resolutions
The members can move resolutions to draw the attention of the
House or the government to matters of general public interest.
The discussion on a resolution is strictly relevant to and within the
scope of the resolution. A member who has moved a resolution or
amendment to a resolution cannot withdraw the same except by
leave of the House.
Resolutions are classified into three categories:16
1. Private Member’s Resolution: It is one that is moved by a
private member (other than a minister). It is discussed only
on alternate Fridays and in the afternoon sitting.
2. Government Resolution: It is one that is moved by a
minister. It can be taken up any day from Monday to
Thursday.
3. Statutory Resolution: It can be moved either by a private
member or a minister. It is so called because it is always
tabled in pursuance of a provision in the Constitution or an
Act of Parliament.
Resolutions are different from motions in the following respects:
“All resolutions come in the category of substantive motions,
that is to say, every resolution is a particular type of motion. All
motions need not necessarily be substantive. Further, all
motions are not necessarily put to vote of the House, whereas
all the resolutions are required to be voted upon.”17
Youth Parliament
The scheme of Youth Parliament was started on the
recommendation of the Fourth All India Whips Conference. Its
objectives are:
1. to acquaint the younger generations with practices and
procedures of Parliament;
2. to imbibe the spirit of discipline and tolerance cultivating
character in the minds of youth; and
3. to inculcate in the student community the basic values of
democracy and to enable them to acquire a proper
perspective on the functioning of democratic institutions.
The ministry of parliamentary affairs provides necessary
training and encouragement to the states in introducing the
scheme.
# LEGISLATIVE  PROCEDURE IN  PARLIAMENT


The legislative procedure is identical in both the Houses of
Parliament. Every bill has to pass through the same stages in
each House. A bill is a proposal for legislation and it becomes an
act or law when duly enacted.
Bills introduced in the Parliament are of two kinds: public bills
and private bills (also known as government bills and private
members’ bills respectively). Though both are governed by the
same general procedure and pass through the same stages in the
House, they differ in various respects as shown in Table 22.3.
The bills introduced in the Parliament can also be classified into
four categories:
1. Ordinary bills, which are concerned with any matter other
than financial subjects.
2. Money bills, which are concerned with the financial matters
like taxation, public expenditure, etc.
3. Financial bills, which are also concerned with financial
matters (but are different from money bills).
4. Constitution amendment bills, which are concerned with the
amendment of the provisions of the Constitution.
The Constitution has laid down separate procedures for the
enactment of all the four types of bills. The procedures with regard
to ordinary bills, money bills and financial bills are explained here.
The procedure with regard to Constitution amendment bills is
explained in detail in Chapter 10.
Ordinary Bills
Every ordinary bill has to pass through the following five stages in
the Parliament before it finds a place on the Statute Book:
1. First Reading
An ordinary bill can be introduced in either House of Parliament.
Such a bill can be introduced either by a minister or by any other
member. The member who wants to introduce the bill has to ask
for the leave of the House. When the House grants leave to
introduce the bill, the mover of the bill introduces it by reading its
title and objectives. No discussion on the bill takes place at this
stage. Later, the bill is published in the Gazette of India. If a bill is
published in the Gazette before its introduction, leave of the
House to introduce the bill is not necessary.18 The introduction of
the bill and its publication in the Gazette constitute the first
reading of the bill.

2. Second Reading
During this stage, the bill receives not only the general but also
the detailed scrutiny and assumes its final shape. Hence, it forms
the most important stage in the enactment of a bill. In fact, this
stage involves three more sub-stages, namely, stage of general
discussion, committee stage and consideration stage.
(a) Stage of General Discussion
The printed copies of the bill are distributed to all the members.
The principles of the bill and its provisions are discussed
generally, but the details of the bill are not discussed.
At this stage, the House can take any one of the following four
actions:
(i) It may take the bill into consideration immediately or on
some other fixed date;
(ii) It may refer the bill to a select committee of the House;
(iii) It may refer the bill to a joint committee of the two Houses;
and
(iv) It may circulate the bill to elicit public opinion.
A Select Committee consists of members of the House where
the bill has originated and a joint committee consists of members
of both the Houses of Parliament.
(b) Committee Stage
The usual practice is to refer the bill to a select committee of the
House. This committee examines the bill thoroughly and in detail,
clause by clause. It can also amend its provisions, but without
altering the principles underlying it. After completing the scrutiny
and discussion, the committee reports the bill back to the House.
(c) Consideration Stage
The House, after receiving the bill from the select committee,
considers the provisions of the bill clause by clause. Each clause
is discussed and voted upon separately. The members can also
move amendments and if accepted, they become part of the bill.
3. Third Reading
At this stage, the debate is confined to the acceptance or rejection
of the bill as a whole and no amendments are allowed, as the
general principles underlying the bill have already been
scrutinised during the stage of second reading. If the majority of
members present and voting accept the bill, the bill is regarded as
passed by the House. Thereafter, the bill is authenticated by the
presiding officer of the House and transmitted to the second
House for consideration and approval. A bill is deemed to have
been passed by the Parliament only when both the Houses have
agreed to it, either with or without amendments.
4. Bill in the Second House
In the second House also, the bill passes through all the three
stages, that is, first reading, second reading and third reading.
There are four alternatives before this House:
(a) it may pass the bill as sent by the first house (ie, without
amendments);
(b) it may pass the bill with amendments and return it to the first
House for reconsideration;
(c) it may reject the bill altogether; and
(d) it may not take any action and thus keep the bill pending.
If the second House passes the bill without any amendments or
the first House accepts the amendments suggested by the second
House, the bill is deemed to have been passed by both the
Houses and the same is sent to the president for his assent. On
the other hand, if the first House rejects the amendments
suggested by the second House or the second House rejects the
bill altogether or the second House does not take any action for
six months, a deadlock is deemed to have taken place. To resolve
such a deadlock, the president can summon a joint sitting of the
two Houses. If the majority of members present and voting in the
joint sitting approves the bill, the bill is deemed to have been
passed by both the Houses.
5. Assent of the President
Every bill after being passed by both Houses of Parliament either
singly or at a joint sitting, is presented to the president for his
assent. There are three alternatives before the president:
(a) he may give his assent to the bill; or
(b) he may withhold his assent to the bill; or
(c) he may return the bill for reconsideration of the Houses.
If the president gives his assent to the bill, the bill becomes an
act and is placed on the Statute Book. If the President withholds
his assent to the bill, it ends and does not become an act. If the
President returns the bill for reconsideration and if it is passed by
both the Houses again with or without amendments and
presented to the President for his assent, the president must give
his assent to the bill. Thus, the President enjoys only a
“suspensive veto.”19
Money Bills
Article 110 of the Constitution deals with the definition of money
bills. It states that a bill is deemed to be a money bill if it contains
‘only’ provisions dealing with all or any of the following matters:
1. The imposition, abolition, remission, alteration or regulation
of any tax;
2. The regulation of the borrowing of money by the Union
government;
3. The custody of the Consolidated Fund of India or the
contingency fund of India, the payment of moneys into or the
withdrawal of money from any such fund;
4. The appropriation of money out of the Consolidated Fund of
India;
5. Declaration of any expenditure charged on the Consolidated
Fund of India or increasing the amount of any such
expenditure;
6. The receipt of money on account of the Consolidated Fund
of India or the public account of India or the custody or issue
of such money, or the audit of the accounts of the Union or
of a state; or
7. Any matter incidental to any of the matters specified above.
However, a bill is not to be deemed to be a money bill by
reason only that it provides for:
1. the imposition of fines or other pecuniary penalties, or
2. the demand or payment of fees for licenses or fees for
services rendered; or
3. the imposition, abolition, remission, alteration or regulation
of any tax by any local authority or body for local purposes.
If any question arises whether a bill is a money bill or not, the
decision of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha is final. His decision in
this regard cannot be questioned in any court of law or in the
either House of Parliament or even the president. When a money
bill is transmitted to the Rajya Sabha for recommendation and
presented to the president for assent, the Speaker endorses it as
a money bill.
The Constitution lays down a special procedure for the passing
of money bills in the Parliament. A money bill can only be
introduced in the Lok Sabha and that too on the recommendation
of the president. Every such bill is considered to be a government
bill and can be introduced only by a minister.
After a money bill is passed by the Lok Sabha, it is transmitted
to the Rajya Sabha for its consideration. The Rajya Sabha has
restricted powers with regard to a money bill. It cannot reject or
amend a money bill. It can only make the recommendations. It
must return the bill to the Lok Sabha within 14 days, whether with
or without recommendations. The Lok Sabha can either accept or
reject all or any of the recommendations of the Rajya Sabha.
If the Lok Sabha accepts any recommendation, the bill is then
deemed to have been passed by both the Houses in the modified
form. If the Lok Sabha does not accept any recommendation, the
bill is then deemed to have passed by both the Houses in the form
originally passed by the Lok Sabha without any change.
If the Rajya Sabha does not return the bill to the Lok Sabha
within 14 days, the bill is deemed to have been passed by both
the Houses in the form originally passed by the Lok Sabha. Thus,
the Lok Sabha has more powers than Rajya Sabha with regard to
a money bill. On the other hand, both the Houses have equal
powers with regard to an ordinary bill.
Finally, when a money bill is presented to the president, he may
either give his assent to the bill or withhold his assent to the bill
but cannot return the bill for reconsideration of the Houses.
Normally, the president gives his assent to a money bill as it is
introduced in the Parliament with his prior permission.
Table 22.4 shows the differences between the procedures for
the enactment of ordinary bills and money bills.
Financial Bills
Financial bills are those bills that deal with fiscal matters, that is,
revenue or expenditure. However, the Constitution uses the term
‘financial bill’ in a technical sense. Financial bills are of three
kinds:
1. Money bills–Article 110
2. Financial bills (I)–Article 117 (1)
3. Financial bills (II)–Article 117 (3)
This classification implies that money bills are simply a species
of financial bills. Hence, all money bills are financial bills but all
financial bills are not money bills. Only those financial bills are
money bills which contain exclusively those matters which are
mentioned in Article 110 of the Constitution. These are also
certified by the Speaker of Lok Sabha as money bills. The
financial bills (I) and (II), on the other hand, have been dealt with
in Article 117 of the Constitution.

Financial Bills (I)
A financial bill (I) is a bill that contains not only any or all the
matters mentioned in Article 110, but also other matters of general
legislation. For instance, a bill that contains a borrowing clause,
but does not exclusively deal with borrowing. In two respects, a
financial bill (I) is similar to a money bill–(a) both of them can be
introduced only in the Lok Sabha and not in the Rajya Sabha, and
(b) both of them can be introduced only on the recommendation of
the president. In all other respects, a financial bill (I) is governed
by the same legislative procedure applicable to an ordinary bill.
Hence, it can be either rejected or amended by the Rajya Sabha
(except that an amendment other than for reduction or abolition of
a tax cannot be moved in either House without the
recommendation of the president i.e., the recommendation of
president is not required for moving an amendment making
provision for the reduction or aboli-sition of a tax). In case of a
disagreement between the two Houses over such a bill, the
president can summon a joint sitting of the two Houses to resolve
the deadlock. When the bill is presented to the President, he can
either give his assent to the bill or withhold his assent to the bill or
return the bill for reconsideration of the Houses.
Financial Bills (II)
A financial bill (II) contains provisions involving expenditure from
the Consolidated Fund of India, but does not include any of the
matters mentioned in Article 110. It is treated as an ordinary bill
and in all respects, it is governed by the same legislative
procedure which is applicable to an ordinary bill. The only special
feature of this bill is that it cannot be passed by either House of
Parliament unless the President has recommended to that House
the consideration of the bill. Hence, financial bill (II) can be
introduced in either House of Parliament and recommendation of
the President is not necessary for its introduction. In other words,
the recommendation of the President is not required at the
introduction stage but is required at the consideration stage. It can
be either rejected or amended by either House of Parliament. In
case of a disagreement between the two Houses over such a bill,
the President can summon a joint sitting of the two Houses to
resolve the deadlock. When the bill is presented to the President,
he can either give his assent to the bill or withhold his assent to
the bill or return the bill for reconsideration of the Houses.
# JOINT  SITTING OF TWO  HOUSES


Joint sitting is an extraordinary machinery provided by the
Constitution to resolve a deadlock between the two Houses over
the passage of a bill. A deadlock is deemed to have taken place
under any one of the following three situations after a bill has
been passed by one House and transmitted to the other House:
1. if the bill is rejected by the other House;
2. if the Houses have finally disagreed as to the amendments
to be made in the bill; or
3. if more than six months have elapsed from the date of the
receipt of the bill by the other House without the bill being
passed by it.
In the above three situations, the president can summon both
the Houses to meet in a joint sitting for the purpose of deliberating
and voting on the bill. It must be noted here that the provision of
joint sitting is applicable to ordinary bills or financial bills only and
not to money bills or Constitutional amendment bills. In the case
of a money bill, the Lok Sabha has overriding powers, while a
Constitutional amendment bill must be passed by each House
separately.
In reckoning the period of six months, no account can be taken
of any period during which the other House (to which the bill has
been sent) is prorogued or adjourned for more than four
consecutive days.
If the bill (under dispute) has already lapsed due to the
dissolution of the Lok Sabha, no joint sitting can be summoned.
But, the joint sitting can be held if the Lok Sabha is dissolved after
the President has notified his intention to summon such a sitting
(as the bill does not lapse in this case). After the President notifies
his intention to summon a joint sitting of the two Houses, none of
the Houses can proceed further with the bill.
The Speaker of Lok Sabha presides over a joint sitting of the
two Houses and the Deputy Speaker, in his absence. If the
Deputy Speaker is also absent from a joint sitting, the Deputy
Chairman of Rajya Sabha presides. If he is also absent, such
other person as may be determined by the members present at
the joint sitting, presides over the meeting. It is clear that the
Chairman of Rajya Sabha does not preside over a joint sitting as
he is not a member of either House of Parliament.
The quorum to constitute a joint sitting is one-tenth of the total
number of members of the two Houses. The joint sitting is
governed by the Rules of Procedure of Lok Sabha and not of
Rajya Sabha.
If the bill in dispute is passed by a majority of the total number
of members of both the Houses present and voting in the joint
sitting, the bill is deemed to have been passed by both the
Houses. Normally, the Lok Sabha with greater number wins the
battle in a joint sitting.
The Constitution has specified that at a joint sitting, new
amendments to the bill cannot be proposed except in two cases:
1. those amendments that have caused final disagreement
between the Houses; and
2. those amendments that might have become necessary due
to the delay in the passage of the bill.
Since 1950, the provision regarding the joint sitting of the two
Houses has been invoked only thrice. The bills that have been
passed at joint sittings are:
1. Dowry Prohibition Bill, 1960.20
2. Banking Service Commission (Repeal)
Bill, 1977.21
3. Prevention of Terrorism Bill, 2002.22
# BUDGET IN  PARLIAMENT


The Constitution refers to the budget as the ‘annual financial
statement’. In other words, the term ‘budget’ has nowhere been
used in the Constitution. It is the popular name for the ‘annual
financial statement’ that has been dealt with in Article 112 of the
Constitution.
The budget is a statement of the estimated receipts and
expenditure of the Government of India in a financial year, which
begins on 1 April and ends on 31 March of the following year.
In addition to the estimates of receipts and expenditure, the
budget contains certain other elements. Overall, the budget
contains the following:
1. Estimates of revenue and capital receipts;
2. Ways and means to raise the revenue;
3. Estimates of expenditure;
4. Details of the actual receipts and expenditure of the closing
financial year and the reasons for any deficit or surplus in
that year; and
5. Economic and financial policy of the coming year, that is,
taxation proposals, prospects of revenue, spending
programme and introduction of new schemes/projects.
Till 2017, the Government of India had two budgets, namely,
the Railway Budget and the General Budget. While the former
consisted of the estimates of receipts and expenditures of only the
Ministry of Railways, the latter consisted of the estimates of
receipts and expenditure of all the ministries of the Government of
India (except the railways).
The Railway Budget was separated from the General Budget in
1924 on the recommendations of the Acworth Committee Report
(1921). The reasons or objectives of this separation were as
follows:
1. To introduce flexibility in railway finance.
2. To facilitate a business approach to the railway policy.
3. To secure stability of the general revenues by providing an
assured annual contribution from railway revenues.
4. To enable the railways to keep their profits for their own
development (after paying a fixed annual contribution to the
general revenues).
In 2017, the Central Government merged the railway budget
into the general budget. Hence, there is now only one budget for
the Government of India i.e., Union Budget.
Constitutional Provisions
The Constitution of India contains the following provisions with
regard to the enactment of budget:
1. The President shall in respect of every financial year cause
to be laid before both the Houses of Parliament a statement
of estimated receipts and expenditure of the Government of
India for that year.
2. No demand for a grant shall be made except on the
recommendation of the President.
3. No money shall be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of
India except under appropriation made by law.
4. No money bill imposing tax shall be introduced in the
Parliament except on the recommendation of the President,
and such a bill shall not be introduced in the Rajya Sabha.
5. No tax shall be levied or collected except by authority of law.
6. Parliament can reduce or abolish a tax but cannot increase
it.
7. The Constitution has also defined the relative roles or
position of both the Houses of Parliament with regard to the
enactment of the budget in the following way:
(a) A money bill or finance bill dealing with taxation cannot
be introduced in the Rajya Sabha–it must be introduced
only in the Lok Sabha.
(b) The Rajya Sabha has no power to vote on the demand
for grants; it is the exclusive privilege of the Lok Sabha.
(c) The Rajya Sabha should return the Money bill (or
Finance bill) to the Lok Sabha within fourteen days. The
Lok Sabha can either accept or reject the
recommendations made by Rajya Sabha in this regard.
8. The estimates of expenditure embodied in the budget shall
show separately the expenditure charged on the
Consolidated Fund of India and the expenditure made from
the Consolidated Fund of India.
9. The budget shall distinguish expenditure on revenue
account from other expenditure.
10. The expenditure charged on the Consolidated Fund of India
shall not be submitted to the vote of Parliament. However, it
can be discussed by the Parliament.
Charged Expenditure
The budget consists of two types of expen-diture–the expenditure
‘charged’ upon the Consolidated Fund of India and the
expenditure ‘made’ from the Consolidated Fund of India. The
charged expenditure is non-votable by the Parliament, that is, it
can only be discussed by the Parliament, while the other type has
to be voted by the Parliament. The list of the charged expenditure
is as follows:
1. Emoluments and allowances of the President and other
expenditure relating to his office.
2. Salaries and allowances of the Chairman and the Deputy
Chairman of the Rajya Sabha and the Speaker and the
Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha.
3. Salaries, allowances and pensions of the judges of the
Supreme Court.
4. Pensions of the judges of high courts.
5. Salary, allowances and pension of the Comptroller and
Auditor General of India.
6. Salaries, allowances and pension of the chairman and
members of the Union Public Service Commission.
7. Administrative expenses of the Supreme Court, the office of
the Comptroller and Auditor General of India and the Union
Public Service Commission including the salaries,
allowances and pensions of the persons serving in these
offices.
8. The debt charges for which the Government of India is
liable, including interest, sinking fund charges and
redemption charges and other expenditure relating to the
raising of loans and the service and redemption of debt.
9. Any sum required to satisfy any judgement, decree or award
of any court or arbitral tribunal.
10. Any other expenditure declared by the Parliament to be so
charged.
Stages in Enactment
The budget goes through the following six stages in the
Parliament:
1. Presentation of budget.
2. General discussion.
3. Scrutiny by departmental committees.
4. Voting on demands for grants.
5. Passing of appropriation bill.
6. Passing of finance bill.
1. Presentation of Budget
Conventionally, the budget is presented to the Lok Sabha by the
finance minister on the last working day of February. Since 2017,
the presentation of the budget has been advanced to 1st of
February.
The Budget can also be presented to the House in two or more
parts and when such presentation takes place, each part shall be
dealt with as if it were the budget. Further, there shall be no
discussion of the budget on the day on which it is presented to the
House.
The finance minister presents the budget with a speech known
as the ‘budget speech’. At the end of the speech in the Lok
Sabha, the budget is laid before the Rajya Sabha, which can only
discuss it and has no power to vote on the demands for grants.
The budget documents presented to the Parliament comprise
of the following :
(i) Budget Speech
(ii) Annual Financial Statement
(iii) Demands for Grants
(iv) Appropriation Bill
(v) Finance Bill
(vi) Statements mandated under the # FRBM Act:


(a) Macro-Economic Framework Statement
(b) Fiscal Policy Strategy Statement
(c) Medium Term Fiscal Policy Statement
(vii) Expenditure Budget
(viii) Receipts Budget
(ix) Expenditure Profile
(x) Memorandum Explaining the Provisions in the Finance Bill
(xi) Budget at a Glance
(xii) Outcome Budget
Earlier, the Economic Survey also used to be presented to the
Parliament along with the budget. Now, it is presented one day or
a few days before the presentation of the budget. This report is
prepared by the finance ministry and indicates the status of the
national economy.
2. General Discussion
The general discussion on budget begins a few days after its
presentation. It takes place in both the Houses of Parliament and
lasts usually for three to four days.
During this stage, the Lok Sabha can discuss the budget as a
whole or on any question of principle involved therein but no cut
motion can be moved nor can the budget be submitted to the vote
of the House. The finance minister has a general right of reply at
the end of the discussion.
3. Scrutiny by Departmental Committees
After the general discussion on the budget is over, the Houses are
adjourned for about three to four weeks. During this gap period,
the 24 departmental standing committees of Parliament examine
and discuss in detail the demands for grants of the concerned
ministers and prepare reports on them. These reports are
submitted to both the Houses of Parliament for consideration.
The standing committee system established in 1993 (and
expanded in 2004) makes parliamentary financial control over
ministries much more detailed, close, in-depth and
comprehensive.
4. Voting on Demands for Grants
In the light of the reports of the departmental standing
committees, the Lok Sabha takes up voting of demands for
grants. The demands are presented ministrywise. A demand
becomes a grant after it has been duly voted.
Two points should be noted in this context. One, the voting of
demands for grants is the exclusive privilege of the Lok Sabha,
that is, the Rajya Sabha has no power of voting the demands.
Second, the voting is confined to the votable part of the budget–
the expenditure charged on the Consolidated Fund of India is not
submitted to the vote (it can only be discussed).
Each demand is voted separately by the Lok Sabha. During this
stage, the members of Parliament can discuss the details of the
budget. They can also move motions to reduce any demand for
grant. Such motions are called as ‘cut motion’, which are of three
kinds:
(a) Policy Cut Motion
It represents the disapproval of the policy underlying the demand.
It states that the amount of the demand be reduced to Re 1. The
members can also advocate an alternative policy.
(b) Economy Cut Motion
It represents the economy that can be affected in the proposed
expenditure. It states that the amount of the demand be reduced
by a specified amount (which may be either a lumpsum reduction
in the demand or ommission or reduction of an item in the
demand).
(c) Token Cut Motion
It ventilates a specific grievance that is within the sphere of
responsibility of the Government of India. It states that the amount
of the demand be reduced by ₹100.
A cut motion, to be admissible, must satisfy the following
conditions:
(i) It should relate to one demand only.
(ii) It should be clearly expressed and should not contain
arguments or defamatory statements.
(iii) It should be confined to one specific matter.
(iv) It should not make suggestions for the amendment or repeal
of existing laws.
(v) It should not refer to a matter that is not primarily the
concern of Union government.
(vi) It should not relate to the expenditure charged on the
Consolidated Fund of India.
(vii) It should not relate to a matter that is under adjudication by a
court.
(viii) It should not raise a question of privilege.
(ix) It should not revive discussion on a matter on which a
decision has been taken in the same session.
(x) It should not relate to a trivial matter.
(xi) It should not reflect on the character or conduct of any
person whose conduct can only be challenged on a
substantive motion.
(xii) It should not anticipate a matter which has been previously
appointed for consideration in the same session.
(xiii) It should not seek to raise a discussion on a matter pending
before any statutory tribunal or statutory authority performing
judicial or quasi-judicial functions or any commission or court
of enquiry.
The significance of a cut motion lies in: (a) facilitating the
initiation of concentrated discussion on a specific demand for
grant; and (b) upholding the principle of responsible government
by probing the activities of the government. However, the cut
motion do not have much utility in practice. They are only moved
and discussed in the House but not passed as the government
enjoys majority support. Their passage by the Lok Sabha amounts
to the expressions of want of parliamentary confidence in the
government and may lead to its resignation.
On the last day of the days allotted for discussion and voting on
the demands for grants, the Speaker puts all the remaining
demands to vote and disposes them whether they have been
discussed by the members or not. This is known as ‘guillotine’.
5. Passing of Appropriation Bill
The Constitution states that ‘no money shall be withdrawn from
the Consolidated Fund of India except under appropriation made
by law’. Accordingly, an appropriation bill is introduced to provide
for the appropriation, out of the Consolidated Fund of India, all
money required to meet:
(a) The grants voted by the Lok Sabha.
(b) The expenditure charged on the Consolidated Fund of India.
No such amendment can be proposed to the appropriation bill
in either house of the Parliament that will have the effect of
varying the amount or altering the destination of any grant voted,
or of varying the amount of any expenditure charged on the
Consolidated Fund of India.
The Appropriation Bill becomes the Appropriation Act after it is
assented to by the President. This act authorises (or legalises) the
payments from the Consolidated Fund of India. This means that
the government cannot withdraw money from the Consolidated
Fund of India till the enactment of the appropriation bill. This takes
time and usually goes on till the end of April. But the government
needs money to carry on its normal activities after 31 March (the
end of the financial year). To overcome this functional difficulty, the
Constitution has authorised the Lok Sabha to make any grant in
advance in respect to the estimated expenditure for a part of the
financial year, pending the completion of the voting of the
demands for grants and the enactment of the appropriation bill.
This provision is known as the ‘vote on account’. It is passed (or
granted) after the general discussion on budget is over. It is
generally granted for two months for an amount equivalent to onesixth
of the total estimation.
6. Passing of Finance Bill
The Finance Bill is introduced to give effect to the financial
proposals of the Government of India for the following year. It is
subjected to all the conditions applicable to a Money Bill. Unlike
the Appropriation Bill, the amendments (seeking to reject or
reduce a tax) can be moved in the case of finance bill.
According to the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act of 1931,
the Finance Bill must be enacted (i.e., passed by the Parliament
and assented to by the president) within 75 days.
The Finance Act legalises the income side of the budget and
completes the process of the enactment of the budget.
Other Grants
In addition to the budget that contains the ordinary estimates of
income and expenditure for one financial year, various other
grants are made by the Parliament under extraordinary or special
circumstances:
Supplementary Grant
It is granted when the amount authorised by the Parliament
through the appropriation act for a particular service for the
current financial year is found to be insufficient for that year.
Additional Grant
It is granted when a need has arisen during the current financial
year for additional expenditure upon some new service not
contemplated in the budget for that year.
Excess Grant
It is granted when money has been spent on any service during a
financial year in excess of the amount granted for that service in
the budget for that year. It is voted by the Lok Sabha after the
financial year. Before the demands for excess grants are
submitted to the Lok Sabha for voting, they must be approved by
the Public Accounts Committee of Parliament.
Vote of Credit
It is granted for meeting an unexpected demand upon the
resources of India, when on account of the magnitude or the
indefinite character of the service, the demand cannot be stated
with the details ordinarily given in a budget. Hence, it is like a
blank cheque given to the Executive by the Lok Sabha.
Exceptional Grant
It is granted for a special purpose and forms no part of the current
service of any financial year.
Token Grant
It is granted when funds to meet the proposed expenditure on a
new service can be made available by reappropriation. A demand
for the grant of a token sum (of Re 1) is submitted to the vote of
the Lok Sabha and if assented, funds are made available.
Reappropriation involves transfer of funds from one head to
another. It does not involve any additional expenditure.
Supplementary, additional, excess and exceptional grants and
vote of credit are regulated by the same procedure which is
applicable in the case of a regular budget.
Funds
The Constitution of India provides for the following three kinds of
funds for the Central government:
1. Consolidated Fund of India (Article 266)
2. Public Account of India (Article 266)
3. Contingency Fund of India (Article 267)
Consolidated Fund of India
It is a fund to which all receipts are credited and all payments are
debited. In other words, (a) all revenues received by the
Government of India; (b) all loans raised by the Government by
the issue of treasury bills, loans or ways and means of advances;
and (c) all money received by the government in repayment of
loans forms the Consolidated Fund of India. All the legally
authorised payments on behalf of the Government of India are
made out of this fund. No money out of this fund can be
appropriated (issued or drawn) except in accordance with a
parliamentary law.
Public Account of India
All other public money (other than those which are credited to the
Consolidated Fund of India) received by or on behalf of the
Government of India shall be credited to the Public Account of
India. This includes provident fund deposits, judicial deposits,
savings bank deposits, departmental deposits, remittances and so
on. This account is operated by executive action, that is, the
payments from this account can by made without parliamentary
appropriation. Such payments are mostly in the nature of banking
transactions.
Contingency Fund of India
The Constitution authorised the Parliament to establish a
‘Contingency Fund of India’, into which amounts determined by
law are paid from time to time. Accordingly, the Parliament
enacted the contingency fund of India Act in 1950. This fund is
placed at the disposal of the president, and he can make
advances out of it to meet unforeseen expenditure pending its
authorisation by the Parliament. The fund is held by the finance
secretary on behalf of the president. Like the public account of
India, it is also operated by executive action.
# MULTIFUNCTIONAL  ROLE OF  PARLIAMENT


In the ‘Indian politico-administrative system’, the Parliament
occupies a central position and has a multifunctional role. It enjoys
extensive powers and performs a variety of functions towards the
fulfilment of its constitutionally expected role. Its powers and
functions can be classified under the following heads:
1. Legislative Powers and Functions
2. Executive Powers and Functions
3. Financial Powers and Functions
4. Constituent Powers and Functions
5. Judicial Powers and Functions
6. Electoral Powers and Functions
7. Other powers and functions.
1. Legislative Powers and Functions
The primary function of Parliament is to make laws for the
governance of the country. It has exclusive power to make laws on
the subjects enumerated in the Union List (which at present has
98 subjects, originally 97 subjects) and on the residuary subjects
(that is, subjects not enumerated in any of the three lists). With
regard to Concurrent List (which has at present 52 subjects,
originally 47 subjects), the Parliament has overriding powers, that
is, the law of Parliament prevails over the law of the state
legislature in case of a conflict between the two.
The Constitution also empowers the Parliament to make laws
on the subjects enumerated in the State List (which at present has
59 subjects, originally 66 subjects) under the following five
abnormal circumstances:
(a) when Rajya Sabha passes a resolution to that effect.
(b) when a proclamation of National Emergency is in operation.
(c) when two or more states make a joint request to the
Parliament.
(d) when necessary to give effect to international agreements,
treaties and conventions.
(e) when President’s Rule is in operation in the state.
All the ordinances issued by the president (during the recess of
the Parliament) must be approved by the Parliament within six
weeks after its reassembly. An ordinance becomes inoperative if it
is not approved by the parliament within that period.
The Parliament makes laws in a skeleton form and authorises
the Executive to make detailed rules and regulations within the
framework of the parent law. This is known as delegated
legislation or executive legislation or subordinate legislation. Such
rules and regulations are placed before the Parliament for its
examination.
2. Executive Powers and Functions
The Constitution of India established a parliamentary form of
government in which the Executive is responsible to the
Parliament for its policies and acts. Hence, the Parliament
exercises control over the Executive through question-hour, zero
hour, half-an-hour discussion, short duration discussion, calling
attention motion, adjournment motion, no-confidence motion,
censure motion and other discussions. It also supervises the
activities of the Executive with the help of its committees like
committee on government assurance, committee on subordinate
legislation, committee on petitions, etc.
The ministers are collectively responsible to the Parliament in
general and to the Lok Sabha in particular. As a part of collective
responsibility, there is individual responsibility, that is, each
minister is individually responsible for the efficient administration
of the ministry under his charge. This means that they continue in
office so long as they enjoy the confidence of the majority
members in the Lok Sabha. In other words, the council of
ministers can be removed from office by the Lok Sabha by
passing a noconfidence motion. The Lok Sabha can also express
lack of confidence in the government in the following ways:
(a) By not passing a motion of thanks on the President’s
inaugural address.
(b) By rejecting a money bill.
(c) By passing a censure motion or an adjournment motion.
(d) By defeating the government on a vital issue.
(e) By passing a cut motion.
Therefore, “the first function of Parliament can be said to be to
select the group which is to form the government, support and
sustain it in power so long as it enjoys its confidence, and to expel
it when it ceases to do so, and leave it to the people to decide at
the next general election.”23
3. Financial Powers and Functions
No tax can be levied or collected and no expenditure can be
incurred by the Executive except under the authority and with the
approval of Parliament. Hence, the budget is placed before the
Parliament for its approval. The enactment of the budget by the
Parliament legalises the receipts and expenditure of the
government for the ensuing financial year.
The Parliament also scrutinises government spending and
financial performance with the help of its financial committees.
These include public accounts committee, estimates committee
and committee on public undertakings. They bring out the cases
of illegal, irregular, unauthorised, improper usage and wastage
and extravagance in public expenditure.
Therefore, the parliamentary control over the Executive in
financial matters operates in two stages:
(a) budgetary control, that is, control before the appropriation of
grants through the enactment of the budget; and
(b) post-budgetary control, that is, control after the appropriation
of grants through the three financial committees.
The budget is based on the principle of annuity, that is, the
Parliament grants money to the government for one financial year.
If the granted money is not spent by the end of the financial year,
then the balance expires and returns to the Consolidated Fund of
India. This practice is known as the ‘rule of lapse’. It facilitates
effective financial control by the Parliament as no reserve funds
can be built without its authorisation. However, the observance of
this rule leads to heavy rush of expenditure towards the close of
the financial year. This is popularly called as ‘March Rush’.
4. Constituent Powers and Functions
The Parliament is vested with the powers to amend the
Constitution by way of addition, variation or repeal of any
provision. The major part of the Constitution can be amended by
the Parliament with special majority, that is, a majority of the total
membership of each House and a majority of not less than twothirds
of the members present and voting in each House. Some
other provisions of the Constitution can be amended by the
Parliament with simple majority, that is, a majority of the members
present and voting in each House of Parliament. Only a few
provisions of the Constitution can be amended by the Parliament
(by special majority) and with the consent of at least half of the
state Legislatures (by simple majority). However, the power to
initiate the process of the amendment of the Constitution (in all the
three cases) lies exclusively in the hands of the Parliament and
not the state legislature. There is only one exception, that is, the
state legislature can pass a resolution requesting the Parliament
for the creation or abolition of the legislative council in the state.
Based on the resolution, the Parliament makes an act for
amending the Constitution to that effect. To sum up, the
Parliament can amend the Constitution in three ways:
(a) By simple majority;
(b) By special majority; and
(c) By special majority but with the consent of half of all the state
legislatures.
The constituent power of the Parliament is not unlimited; it is
subject to the ‘basic structure’ of the Constitution. In others words,
the Parliament can amend any provision of the Constitution
except the ‘basic features’ of the Constitution. This was ruled by
the Supreme Court in the Kesavananda Bharati case (1973) and
reaffirmed in the Minerva Mills case (1980)24 .
5. Judicial Powers and Functions
The judicial powers and functions of the Parliament include the
following:
(a) It can impeach the President for the violation of the
Constitution.
(b) It can remove the Vice-President from his office.
(c) It can recommend the removal of judges (including chief
justice) of the Supreme Court and the high courts, chief
election commissioner, comptroller and auditor general to the
president.
(d) It can punish its members or outsiders for the breach of its
privileges or its contempt.
6. Electoral Powers and Functions
The Parliament participates in the election of the President (along
with the state legislative assemblies) and elects the Vice-
President. The Lok Sabha elects its Speaker and Deputy Speaker,
while the Rajya Sabha elects its Deputy Chairman.
The Parliament is also authorised to make laws to regulate the
elections to the offices of President and Vice-President, to both
the Houses of Parliament and to both the Houses of state
legislature. Accordingly, Parliament enacted the Presidential and
Vice-Presidential Election Act (1952), the Representation of
People Act (1950), the Representation of People Act (1951), etc.
7. Other Powers and Functions
The various other powers and functions of the Parliament include:
(a) It serves as the highest deliberative body in the country. It
discusses various issues of national and international
significance.
(b) It approves all the three types of emergencies (national, state
and financial) proclaimed by the President.
(c) It can create or abolish the state legislative councils on the
recommendation of the concerned state legislative
assemblies.
(d) It can increase or decrease the area, alter the boundaries
and change the names of states of the Indian Union.
(e) It can regulate the organisation and jurisdiction of the
Supreme Court and high courts and can establish a common
high court for two or more states.
# INEFFECTIVENESS OF  PARLIAMENTARY  CONTROL


The parliamentary control over government and administration in
India is more theoretical than practical. In reality, the control is not
as effective as it ought to be. The following factors are responsible
for this:
(a) The Parliament has neither time nor expertise to control the
administration which has grown in volume as well as
complexity.
(b) Parliament’s financial control is hindered by the technical
nature of the demands for grants. The parliamentarians being
laymen cannot understand them properly and fully.
(c) The legislative leadership lies with the Executive and it plays
a significant role in formulating policies.
(d) The very size of the Parliament is too large and
unmanagable to be effective.
(e) The majority support enjoyed by the Executive in the
Parliament reduces the possibility of effective criticism.
(f) The financial committees like Public Accounts Committee
examines the public expenditure after it has been incurred by
the Executive. Thus, they do post mortem work.
(g) The increased recourse to ‘guillotine’ reduced the scope of
financial control.
(h) The growth of ‘delegated legislation’ has reduced the role of
Parliament in making detailed laws and has increased the
powers of bureaucracy.
(i) The frequent promulgation of ordinances by the president
dilutes the Parliament’s power of legislation.
(j) The Parliament’s control is sporadic, general and mostly
political in nature.
(k) Lack of strong and steady opposition in the Parliament, and a
setback in the parliamentary behaviour and ethics, have also
contributed to the ineffectiveness of legislative control over
administration in India.
# POSITION OF  RAJYA  SABHA


The Constitutional position of the Rajya Sabha (as compared with
the Lok Sabha) can be studied from three angles:
1. Where Rajya Sabha is equal to Lok Sabha.
2. Where Rajya Sabha is unequal to Lok Sabha.
3. Where Rajya Sabha has special powers that are not at all
shared with the Lok Sabha.
Equal Status with Lok Sabha
In the following matters, the powers and status of the Rajya
Sabha are equal to that of the Lok Sabha:
1. Introduction and passage of ordinary bills.
2. Introduction and passage of Constitutional amendment bills.
3. Introduction and passage of financial bills involving
expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of India.
4. Election and impeachment of the president.
5. Election and removal of the Vice-President. However, Rajya
Sabha alone can initiate the removal of the vice-president.
He is removed by a resolution passed by the Rajya Sabha
by an effective majority (which is a type of special majority)
and agreed to by the Lok Sabha by a simple majority.
6. Making recommendation to the President for the removal of
Chief Justice and judges of Supreme Court and high courts,
chief election commissioner and comptroller and auditor
general.
7. Approval of ordinances issued by the President.
8. Approval of proclamation of all three types of emergencies
by the President.
9. Selection of ministers including the Prime Minister. Under
the Constitution, the ministers including the Prime Minister
can be members of either House. However, irrespective of
their membership, they are responsible only to the Lok
Sabha.
10. Consideration of the reports of the constitutional bodies like
Finance Commission, Union Public Service Commission,
comptroller and auditor general, etc.
11. Enlargement of the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and
the Union Public Service Commission.
Unequal Status with Lok Sabha
In the following matters, the powers and status of the Rajya
Sabha are unequal to that of the Lok Sabha:
1. A Money Bill can be introduced only in the Lok Sabha and
not in the Rajya Sabha.
2. Rajya Sabha cannot amend or reject a Money Bill. It should
return the bill to the Lok Sabha within 14 days, either with
recommendations or without recommendations.
3. The Lok Sabha can either accept or reject all or any of the
recommendations of the Rajya Sabha. In both the cases, the
money bill is deemed to have been passed by the two
Houses.
4. A financial bill, not containing solely the matters of Article
110, also can be introduced only in the Lok Sabha and not in
the Rajya Sabha. But, with regard to its passage, both the
Houses have equal powers.
5. The final power to decide whether a particular bill is a Money
Bill or not is vested in the Speaker of the Lok Sabha.
6. The Speaker of Lok Sabha presides over the joint sitting of
both the Houses.
7. The Lok Sabha with greater number wins the battle in a joint
sitting except when the combined strength of the ruling party
in both the Houses is less than that of the opposition parties.
8. Rajya Sabha can only discuss the budget but cannot vote
on the demands for grants (which is the exclusive privilege
of the Lok Sabha).
9. A resolution for the discontinuance of the national
emergency can be passed only by the Lok Sabha and not by
the Rajya Sabha.
10. The Rajya Sabha cannot remove the council of ministers by
passing a no-confidence motion. This is because the Council
of ministers is collectively responsible only to the Lok Sabha.
But, the Rajya Sabha can discuss and criticise the policies
and activities of the government.
Special Powers of Rajya Sabha
The Rajya Sabha has been given four exclusive or special powers
that are not enjoyed by the Lok Sabha:
1. It can authorise the Parliament to make a law on a subject
enumerated in the State List (Article 249).
2. It can authorise the Parliament to create new All-India
Services common to both the Centre and states (Article
312).
3. It alone can initiate a move for the removal of the vicepresident.
In other words, a resolution for the removal of the
vice-president can be introduced only in the Rajya Sabha
and not in the Lok Sabha (Article 67).
4. If a proclamation is issued by the President for imposing
national emergency or president’s rule or financial
emergency at a time when the Lok Sabha has been
dissolved or the dissolution of the Lok Sabha takes place
within the period allowed for its approval, then the
proclamation can remain effective even if it is approved by
the Rajya Sabha alone (Articles 352, 356 and 360).
An analysis of the above points makes it clear that the position
of the Rajya Sabha in our constitutional system is not as weak as
that of the House of Lords in the British constitutional system nor
as strong as that of the Senate in the American constitutional
system. Except in financial matters and control over the council of
ministers, the powers and status of the Rajya Sabha in all other
spheres are broadly equal and coordinate with that of the Lok
Sabha.
Even though the Rajya Sabha has been given less powers as
compared with the Lok Sabha, its utility is supported on the
following grounds:
1. It checks hasty, defective, careless and ill-considered
legislation made by the Lok Sabha by making provision of
revision and thought.
2. It facilitates giving representation to eminent professionals
and experts who cannot face the direct election. The
President nominates 12 such persons to the Rajya Sabha.
3. It maintains the federal equilibrium by protecting the
interests of the states against the undue interference of the
Centre.
# PARLIAMENTARY  PRIVILEGES


Meaning
Parliamentary privileges are special rights, immunities and
exemptions enjoyed by the two Houses of Parliament, their
committees and their members. They are necessary in order to
secure the independence and effectiveness of their actions.
Without these privileges, the Houses can neither maintain their
authority, dignity and honour nor can protect their members from
any obstruction in the discharge of their parliamentary
responsibilities.
The Constitution has also extended the parliamentary privileges
to those persons who are entitled to speak and take part in the
proceedings of a House of Parliament or any of its committees.
These include the attorney general of India and Union ministers.
It must be clarified here that the parliamentary privileges do not
extend to the president who is also an integral part of the
Parliament.
Classification
Parliamentary privileges can be classified into two broad
categories:
1. those that are enjoyed by each House of Parliament
collectively, and
2. those that are enjoyed by the members individually.
Collective Privileges
The privileges belonging to each House of Parliament collectively
are:
1. It has the right to publish its reports, debates and
proceedings and also the right to prohibit others from
publishing the same. The 44th Amendment Act of 1978
restored the freedom of the press to publish true reports of
parliamentary proceedings without prior permission of the
House. But this is not applicable in the case of a secret
sitting of the House.
2. It can exclude strangers from its proceedings and hold
secret sittings to discuss some important matters.
3. It can make rules to regulate its own procedure and the
conduct of its business and to adjudicate upon such matters.
4. It can punish members as well as outsiders for breach of its
privileges or its contempt by reprimand, admonition or
imprisonment (also suspension or expulsion, in case of
members).25
5. It has the right to receive immediate information of the
arrest, detention, conviction, imprisonment and release of a
member.
6. It can institute inquiries and order the attendance of
witnesses and send for relevant papers and records.
7. The courts are prohibited to inquire into the proceedings of a
House or its committees.
8. No person (either a member or outsider) can be arrested,
and no legal process (civil or criminal) can be served within
the precincts of the House without the permission of the
presiding officer.
Individual Privileges
The privileges belonging to the members individually are:
1. They cannot be arrested during the session of Parliament
and 40 days before the beginning and 40 days after the end
of a session. This privilege is available only in civil cases
and not in criminal cases or preventive detention cases.
2. They have freedom of speech in Parliament. No member is
liable to any proceedings in any court for anything said or
any vote given by him in Parliament or its committees. This
freedom is subject to the provisions of the Constitution and
to the rules and standing orders regulating the procedure of
Parliament.26
3. They are exempted from jury service. They can refuse to
give evidence and appear as a witness in a case pending in
a court when Parliament is in session.
Breach of Privilege and Contempt of the House
“When any individual or authority disregards or attacks any of
the privileges, rights and immunities, either of the member
individually or of the House in its collective capacity, the offence
is termed as breach of privilege and is punishable by the
House.”27
Any act or omission which obstructs a House of Parliament, its
member or its officer in the performance of their functions or which
has a tendency, directly or indirectly to produce results against the
dignity, authority and honour of the House is treated as a
contempt of the House.28
Though the two phrases, ‘breach of privilege’ and ‘contempt of
the House’ are used interchangeably, they have different
implications. ‘Normally, a breach of privilege may amount to
contempt of the House. Likewise, contempt of the House may
include a breach of privilege also. Contempt of the House,
however, has wider implications. There may be a contempt of the
House without specifically committing a breach of privilege’.29
Similarly, ‘actions which are not breaches of any specific privilege
but are offences against the dignity and authority of the House
amount to contempt of the House’.30 For example, disobedience
to a legitimate order of the House is not a breach of privilege, but
can be punished as contempt of the House.
Sources of Privileges
Originally, the Constitution (Article 105) expressedly mentioned
two privileges, that is, freedom of speech in Parliament and right
of publication of its proceedings. With regard to other privileges, it
provided that they were to be the same as those of the British
House of Commons, its committees and its members on the date
of its commencement (ie, 26 January, 1950), until defined by
Parliament. The 44th Amendment Act of 1978 provided that the
other privileges of each House of Parliament, its committees and
its members are to be those which they had on the date of its
commencement (ie, 20 June, 1979), until defined by Parliament.
This means that the position with regard to other privileges
remains same. In other words, the amendment has made only
verbal changes by dropping a direct reference to the British House
of Commons, without making any change in the implication of the
provision.31
It should be noted here that the Parliament, till now, has not
made any special law to exhaustively codify all the privileges.
They are based on five sources, namely,
1. Constitutional provisions,
2. Various laws made by Parliament,
3. Rules of both the Houses,
4. Parliamentary conventions, and
5. Judicial interpretations.
# SOVEREIGNTY OF  PARLIAMENT


The doctrine of ‘sovereignty of Parliament’ is associated with the
British Parliament. Sovereignty means the supreme power within
the State. That supreme power in Great Britain lies with the
Parliament. There are no ‘legal’ restrictions on its authority and
jurisdiction.
Therefore, the sovereignty of Parliament (parliamentary
supremacy) is a cardinal feature of the British constitutional
system. According to AV Dicey, the British jurist, this principle has
three implications:32
1. The Parliament can make, amend, substitute or repeal any
law. De Lolme, a British political analyst, said, ‘The British
Parliament can do every thing except make a woman a man
and a man a woman’.
2. The Parliament can make constitutional laws by the same
procedure as ordinary laws. In other words, there is no legal
distinction between the constituent authority and the
legislative authority of the British Parliament.
3. The Parliamentary laws cannot be declared invalid by the
Judiciary as being unconstitutional. In other words, there is
no system of judicial review in Britain.
The Indian Parliament, on the other hand, cannot be regarded
as a sovereign body in the similar sense as there are ‘legal’
restrictions on its authority and jurisdiction. The factors that limit
the sovereignty of Indian Parliament are:
1. Written Nature of the Constitution
The Constitution is the fundamental law of the land in our country.
It has defined the authority and jurisdiction of all the three organs
of the Union government and the nature of interrelationship
between them. Hence, the Parliament has to operate within the
limits prescribed by the Constitution. There is also a legal
distinction between the legislative authority and the constituent
authority of the Parliament. Moreover, to effect certain
amendments to the Constitution, the ratification of half of the
states is also required. In Britain, on the other hand, the
Constitution is neither written nor there is anything like a
fundamental law of the land.
2. Federal System of Government
India has a federal system of government with a constitutional
division of powers between the Union and the states. Both have to
operate within the spheres allotted to them. Hence, the lawmaking
authority of the Parliament gets confined to the subjects
enumerated in the Union List and Concurrent List and does not
extend to the subjects enumerated in the State List (except in five
abnormal circumstances and that too for a short period). Britain,
on the other hand, has a unitary system of government and
hence, all the powers are vested in the Centre.
3. System of Judicial Review
The adoption of an independent Judiciary with the power of
judicial review also restricts the supremacy of our Parliament.
Both the Supreme Court and high courts can declare the laws
enacted by the Parliament as void and ultra vires
(unconstitutional), if they contravene any provision of the
Constitution. On the other hand, there is no system of judicial
review in Britain. The British Courts have to apply the
Parliamentary laws to specific cases, without examining their
constitutionality, legality or reasonableness.
4. Fundamental Rights
The authority of the Parliament is also restricted by the
incorporation of a code of justiciable fundamental rights under
Part III of the Constitution. Article 13 prohibits the State from
making a law that either takes away totally or abrogates in part a
fundamental right. Hence, a Parliamentary law that contravenes
the fundamental rights shall be void. In Britain, on the other hand,
there is no codification of justiciable fundamental rights in the
Constitution. The British Parliament has also not made any law
that lays down the fundamental rights of the citizens. However, it
does not mean that the British citizens do not have rights. Though
there is no charter guaranteeing rights, there is maximum liberty in
Britain due to the existence of the Rule of Law.
Therefore, even though the nomenclature and organisational
pattern of our Parliament is similar to that of the British
Parliament, there is a substantial difference between the two. The
Indian Parliament is not a sovereign body in the sense in which
the British Parliament is a sovereign body. Unlike the British
Parliament, the authority and jurisdiction of the Indian Parliament
are defined, limited and restrained.
In this regard, the Indian Parliament is similar to the American
Legislature (known as Congress). In USA also, the sovereignty of
Congress is legally restricted by the written character of the
Constitution, the federal system of government, the system of
judicial review and the Bill of Rights.

office provided with such extensive authority and power
must discharge the duties of his office impartially. So
impartiality is regarded as an indispensable condition of
the office of the Speaker, who is the guardian of the
powers and privileges of the House and not of the
political party with whose support he might have been
elected to the office. It is not possible for him to maintain
order in the House unless he enjoys the confidence of
the minority parties by safeguarding their rights and
privileges”. (‘Powers of the Presiding Officers in Indian
