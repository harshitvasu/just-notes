Biological Activity
The vegetative cover and organisms that occupy
the parent materials from the beginning and also
at later stages help in adding organic matter,
moisture retention, nitrogen etc. Dead plants
provide humus, the finely divided organic matter
of the soil. Some organic acids which form
during humification aid in decomposing the
minerals of the soil parent materials.
Intensity of bacterial activity shows up
differences between soils of cold and warm
climates. Humus accumulates in cold climates
as bacterial growth is slow. With
undecomposed organic matter because of low
bacterial activity, layers of peat develop in subarctic
and tundra climates. In humid tropical
and equatorial climates, bacterial growth and
action is intense and dead vegetation is rapidly
oxidised leaving very low humus content in
the soil. Further, bacteria and other soil
organisms take gaseous nitrogen from the air
and convert it into a chemical form that can
be used by plants. This process is known as
nitrogen fixation. Rhizobium, a type of
bacteria, lives in the root nodules of leguminous
plants and fixes nitrogen beneficial to the host
plant. The influence of large animals like ants,
termites, earthworms, rodents etc., is
mechanical, but, it is nevertheless important
in soil formation as they rework the soil up
and down. In case of earthworms, as they
feed on soil, the texture and chemistry of the
soil that comes out of their body changes.

Think of living organisms as the vital spark that transforms raw parent material into rich, living soil. Let's explore their diverse roles:

**Plants: Soil Pioneers and Nourishers**

Plants are the primary source of organic matter in soil. As they die and decompose, they create humus â€“ the dark, nutrient-rich heart of fertile soil. Humus improves water retention, adds valuable nitrogen, and provides food to support countless soil organisms.

Additionally, the roots of plants help break down rock material, creating pathways for air and water within the soil. They act like tiny soil engineers!

**Organic Acids: Unlocking Minerals**

The process of humification releases natural organic acids into the soil. These acids play a crucial role in weathering, dissolving minerals within the parent material and making those nutrients available for uptake by plants.

**Bacterial Climates**

Temperature dramatically impacts bacterial activity, leaving a distinct signature on soil development:

- Cold Climates: Bacterial growth slows down, so organic matter decomposes slowly. This leads to thick layers of peat in subarctic and tundra regions.
    
- Warm Climates: Bacteria flourish, rapidly breaking down plant matter. This means low humus content in tropical soils, as material decomposes so quickly.
    

**Nitrogen Fixation: Essential Nutrient Boost**

Bacteria and other soil microorganisms perform a fascinating feat called nitrogen fixation. They capture nitrogen from the air and transform it into usable forms for plants. This is vital for plant growth! Certain bacteria, like Rhizobium, form a symbiotic relationship with legumes, living in root nodules and providing the plant with a vital source of nitrogen.

**Animal Earthmovers**

Larger creatures like ants, termites, earthworms, and rodents are soil remixers. They burrow, tunnel, and turn over soil, improving aeration and drainage. Earthworms are particularly remarkable: as they feed, they change the soil's chemistry and texture, leaving behind nutrient-rich worm castings.

**The Bottom Line**

The biological activity within the soil is a hidden world, teeming with life that shapes soil formation. Understanding how living organisms interact with the other soil-forming factors is key for comprehending diverse soil types and their role in supporting vibrant ecosystems.
