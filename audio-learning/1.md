The Earth's crust is constantly changing. Two main forces are at play:

- **Internal forces (endogenic):** These come from within the Earth and cause mountain building, earthquakes, and volcanoes. While less intense than before, they still reshape the planet's surface.
- **External forces (exogenic):** Driven by the sun's energy, these forces include weathering, erosion from wind, water, and ice. They wear down and level the Earth's features over time.

These forces are constantly battling it out:

- **Degradation:** Exogenic forces erode mountains and high points, reducing their elevation.
- **Aggradation:** The eroded material gets deposited in valleys and depressions, filling them up.

Endogenic forces build up, while exogenic forces wear down. This ongoing battle creates and maintains the Earth's varied topography.

Understanding these processes is crucial for using the Earth responsibly. We need to manage our impact to avoid harming the planet's ability to sustain life in the future. Human actions have significantly sped up changes to the Earth's surface compared to natural processes.

The Earth's a complex system shaped over vast timescales. By appreciating these forces, we can become better stewards, using resources without compromising the planet's future.
