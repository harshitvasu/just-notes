ENDOGENIC PROCESSES The energy emanating from within the earth is the main force behind endogenic geomorphic processes. This energy is mostly generated by radioactivity, rotational and tidal friction and primordial heat from the origin of the earth. This energy due to geothermal gradients and heat flow from within induces diastrophism and volcanism in the lithosphere. Due to variations in geothermal gradients and heat flow from within, crustal thickness and strength, the action of endogenic forces are not uniform and hence the tectonically controlled original crustal surface is uneven. Elaborate and explain in detail for conceptual depth covering all facts. and practical examples wherever possible. 

**Endogenic Processes: The Earth's Internal Engine**

Endogenic processes shape Earth's landscapes from within, driven by powerful forces beneath the surface:

- **Source of Energy:**
    
    - **Radioactivity:** Decay of radioactive elements deep inside Earth generates tremendous heat.
    - **Rotational and Tidal Friction:** The Earth's spin and Moon's gravitational pull create friction, adding more heat.
    - **Primordial Heat:** This is the leftover heat from Earth's fiery formation billions of years ago.
- **Mechanisms:**
    
    - **Geothermal Gradients:** Temperature differences within the Earth create rising and sinking currents of material.
    - **Heat Flow:** This movement of heat drives large-scale changes in the Earth's crust and mantle.
    - **Diastrophism:** This refers to slow warping, bending, and fracturing of the Earth's crust, leading to:
        - Folding: Compression forces create bends in rock layers (example: Himalayan Mountains)
        - Faulting: Rock layers break and slide past each other (example: San Andreas Fault)
    - **Volcanism:** Molten rock (magma) from the mantle erupts onto the surface or intrudes into existing rock layers, building new landforms (example: volcanic islands like Hawaii).
- **Uneven Crustal Landscape:**
    
    - Geothermal gradients, heat flow, and crustal thickness vary around the globe.
    - This means endogenic forces act with different intensities in different regions.
    - The result is a constantly changing, uneven crust with mountains, valleys, trenches, and basins.

**Practical Examples:**

- **Earthquakes:** Sudden slippage along faults releases built-up energy from endogenic processes.
- **Mountain Ranges:** Uplifting and folding caused by plate collisions driven by internal heat (e.g., the Andes).
- **Oceanic Ridges:** Spreading zones where new seafloor is created by upwelling magma (e.g., the Mid-Atlantic Ridge).
- **Volcanic Islands:** Formation through repeated eruptions from hot spots in the mantle (e.g., Hawaiian Island chain).

**Key Points:**

- Endogenic processes are the primary landform builders on a large scale.
- They reflect the immense energy and constant change within Earth's interior.
- Understanding these processes helps us decipher the planet's geological history and predict future hazards.
