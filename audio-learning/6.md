Volcanism
Volcanism includes the movement of molten
rock (magma) onto or toward the earth’s
surface and also formation of many intrusive
and extrusive volcanic forms. Many aspects of
volcanism have already been dealt in detail
under volcanoes in the Unit II and under
igneous rocks in the preceding chapter in this
unit.

Here's a detailed breakdown of volcanism, focusing on its key processes, forms, and impacts:

**The Journey of Magma**

- **Magma Genesis:** Volcanism begins deep within the Earth where intense heat and pressure cause rock to melt, creating magma. Factors controlling the melting point include rock composition, the presence of water, and changes in pressure.
- **Magma Ascent:** Being lighter than the surrounding solid rock, magma rises buoyantly towards the Earth's surface. As it travels, gases trapped within the magma start to expand, creating pressure that can lead to eruptions.
- **Surface Eruption:** When magma reaches the surface, it is termed lava. Eruptions can be spectacularly explosive (e.g., Mount St. Helens) or gentle outpourings of fluid lava (e.g., Hawaii's Kilauea).

**Volcanic Forms**

Volcanism creates a wide variety of structures, classified as extrusive (formed on the surface) and intrusive (formed within the crust):

- **Extrusive Forms**
    
    - **Shield Volcanoes:** Formed by low-viscosity basaltic lava flows, these have broad, gentle slopes (e.g., Mauna Loa, Hawaii).
    - **Cinder Cones:** Built by the accumulation of ash and cinders, forming steep, conical hills (e.g., Parícutin, Mexico).
    - **Composite Volcanoes (Stratovolcanoes):** Alternating layers of lava and ash create tall, picturesque mountains with steeper slopes (e.g., Mount Fuji, Japan).
    - **Lava Plateaus:** Vast expanses created by repeated, fluid lava flows (e.g., the Deccan Traps, India).
- **Intrusive Forms**
    
    - **Dikes:** Sheet-like vertical intrusions of magma cutting across existing rock layers.
    - **Sills:** Horizontal intrusions of magma that squeeze between layers of rock.
    - **Batholiths:** Giant, irregularly shaped bodies of solidified magma formed deep within the crust.

**The Impact of Volcanism**

Volcanism has profound effects on the environment and human societies:

- **Hazards:** Explosive eruptions pose dangers like ash fall, pyroclastic flows (fast-moving avalanches of hot gas and debris), and lahars (volcanic mudflows).
- **Fertile Soils:** Weathered volcanic rocks breakdown to form remarkably rich soils, supporting agriculture near volcanoes.
- **Geothermal Energy:** The heat within volcanic regions can be harnessed as a source of geothermal energy.
- **Climate Change:** Large volcanic eruptions can inject vast quantities of gases and particles into the atmosphere, potentially having cooling effects on the climate.
- **Formation of Ore Deposits:** The circulation of fluids within volcanically active regions can lead to the concentration of valuable minerals and ores.

**Understanding volcanism is crucial** for hazard mitigation, exploiting resources, and appreciating the dynamic forces that shape our planet.
