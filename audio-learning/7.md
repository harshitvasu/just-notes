## EXOGENIC PROCESSES The exogenic processes derive their energy from atmosphere determined by the ultimate energy from the sun and also the gradients created by tectonic factors. Gravitational force acts upon all earth materials having a sloping surface and tend to produce movement of matter in down slope direction. Force applied per unit area is called stress. Stress is produced in a solid by pushing or pul l ing. This induces deformation. Forces acting along the faces of earth materials are shear stresses (separating forces). It is this stress that breaks rocks and other earth materials. The shear stresses result in angular displacement or slippage. Besides the gravitational stress earth materials become subjected to molecular stresses that may be caused by a number of factors amongst which temperature changes, crystallisation and melting are the most common. Chemical processes normally lead to loosening of bonds between grains, dissolving of soluble minerals or cementing materials. Thus, the basic reason that leads to weathering, mass movements, and erosion is development of stresses in the body of the earth materials. Temperature and precipitation are the two important climatic elements that control various processes. All the exogenic geomorphic processes are covered under a general term, denudation. The word â€˜denudeâ€™ means to strip off or to uncover. Weathering, mass wast ing/movements, erosion and transportation are included in denudation.

Absolutely, let's dive into the intricate world of exogenic processes:

**What are Exogenic Processes?**

- Exogenic processes are forces that shape the Earth's surface. They derive their energy from two main sources:
    - **The Sun:** Solar radiation drives temperature variations and the water cycle, fueling processes like weathering and erosion.
    - **Tectonic Forces:** Uplift and subsidence caused by tectonic activity create slopes and gradients.

**The Role of Gravity and Stress**

- **Gravity:** An ever-present force, gravity acts on all materials on slopes, constantly urging them to move downwards.
- **Stress:** Forces acting on Earth materials within the crust. Types of stress include:
    - **Shear Stress:** Causes rocks to break through slippage or angular displacement.
    - **Molecular Stress:** Induced by temperature changes, crystallization, and melting, altering the internal structure of rocks.
    - **Chemical Stress:** Attacks the mineral composition of the rock, weakening bonds, and making it susceptible to breakdown.

**Climate: The Driving Force**

- **Temperature:** Fluctuations in temperature cause expansion and contraction in rocks, leading to physical breakdown. Think of cracks forming in a road due to repeated freezing and thawing.
- **Precipitation:** Rain, snow, and ice are key players in weathering (disintegration of rocks), erosion (removal of weathered material), and transportation of the material itself.

**Denudation: The Umbrella Term**

Denudation encompasses all exogenic processes that wear down and reshape the Earth's surface. It includes:

- **Weathering:** The breaking down of rocks in place (more on this below).
- **Mass Wasting/Movements:** The downslope movement of soil and rock due to gravity (e.g., landslides, rockfalls).
- **Erosion:** The removal and transportation of weathered material by agents like water, wind, and glaciers.

**Weathering**

A crucial aspect of denudation, weathering is the in-situ (on-site) breakdown of rocks. There are three main types:

1. **Physical (Mechanical) Weathering**
    
    - **Freeze-thaw:** Water seeps into rock cracks, freezes and expands, widening the cracks, and eventually breaking the rock apart.
    - **Salt wedging:** Similar to freeze-thaw, but with salt crystal growth causing the expansion.
    - **Thermal expansion and contraction:** Repeated heating and cooling causes rocks to expand and contract, creating stress.
2. **Chemical Weathering**
    
    - **Solution:** Some minerals dissolve easily in water, leading to the weakening of rocks.
    - **Oxidation:** Iron-bearing minerals react with oxygen, forming rust and weakening the rock.
    - **Hydrolysis:** Chemical reactions with water break down minerals.
3. **Biological Weathering**
    
    - **Plant Roots:** Roots force their way into cracks in rocks, widening them.
    - **Burrowing organisms:** Animals digging can loosen and displace soil and rocks.
    - **Chemical breakdown by organisms:** Lichens and mosses produce acids that can dissolve rock.

**In Summary**

Exogenic processes work continuously to sculpt the world around us. They are influenced by the sun's energy, tectonic slopes, gravity, climate, and even living organisms. Understanding the complex interplay of these forces is essential for grasping how landscapes evolve over time.
