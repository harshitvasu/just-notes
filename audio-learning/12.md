Physical Weathering Processes
Physical or mechanical weathering processes
depend on some applied forces. The applied
forces could be: (i) gravitational forces such as
overburden pressure, load and shearing stress;
(ii) expansion forces due to temperature
changes, crystal growth or animal activity;
(iii) water pressures controlled by wetting and
drying cycles. Many of these forces are applied
both at the surface and within different earth
materials leading to rock fracture. Most of
the physical weathering processes are caused
by thermal expansion and pressure release.
These processes are small and slow but can
cause great damage to the rocks because of
continued fatigue the rocks suffer due to
repetition of contraction and expansion.

Physical weathering encompasses the mechanical breakdown of rocks without altering their chemical composition. It's driven by various forces that cause rocks to crack, split, and disintegrate:

- **Gravitational Forces:** The weight of overlying rocks (overburden pressure) and geological stresses can squeeze and shear rock layers. This leads to fracturing, especially along existing lines of weakness. Such forces are particularly active deep below the surface and near tectonic boundaries.
    
- **Expansion and Contraction:** Temperature fluctuations cause rocks to expand (when heated) and contract (when cooled). Repeated expansion-contraction cycles create stress, weakening rocks and eventually causing them to crack. This is common in areas with high daily temperature variations, like deserts. Similarly, the freezing of water within rock cracks exerts significant pressure as ice expands, wedging the cracks further open. This freeze-thaw process is prominent in colder climates.
    
- **Crystal Growth:** Salt crystals forming within rock pores and cracks can exert outward pressure as they grow in size, promoting the disintegration of rocks. This is often seen in coastal regions or arid environments where salt-laden water evaporates.
    
- **Biological Activity:** Plant roots can penetrate cracks, and as they grow, they exert pressure, widening the cracks or dislodging rock fragments. Animal burrowing and movement can also loosen and fracture rocks.
    

Physical weathering processes play a vital role in landscape evolution. They reduce large rocks into smaller fragments, facilitating further weathering and erosion. These processes create the raw material for soil formation and influence landform features â€“ from fractured cliffs to smooth, rounded boulders.
