WEATHERING
Weathering is action of elements of weather and
climate over earth materials. There are a
number of processes within weathering which
act either individually or together to affect the
earth materials in order to reduce them to
fragmental state.
As very little or no motion of materials
takes place in weathering, it is an in-situ or
on-site process.
Weathering processes are conditioned by
many complex geological, climatic, topographic
and vegetative factors. Climate is of particular
importance. Not only weathering processes
differ from climate to climate, but also the depth
of the weathering mantle (Figure 5.2).
There are three major groups of weathering
processes : (i) chemical; (ii) physical or
mechanical; (iii) biological weathering processes.
Very rarely does any one of these processes ever
operate completely by itself, but quite often a
dominance of one process can be seen.
