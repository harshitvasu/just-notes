Several activating causes precede mass
movements. They are : (i) removal of support
from below to materials above through natural
or artificial means; (ii) increase in gradient and
height of slopes; (iii) overloading through
addition of materials naturally or by artificial
filling; (iv) overloading due to heavy rainfall,
saturation and lubrication of slope materials;
(v) removal of material or load from over the
original slope surfaces; (vi) occurrence of
earthquakes, explosions or machinery;
(vii) excessive natural seepage; (viii) heavy
drawdown of water from lakes, reservoirs and
rivers leading to slow outflow of water from
under the slopes or river banks; (ix) indiscriminate
removal of natural vegetation.
Heave (heaving up of soils due to frost
growth and other causes), flow and slide are
the three forms of movements. Figure 5.5 shows
the relationships among different types of mass
movements, their relative rates of movement
and moisture limits.

Let's unpack the triggers and mechanics of mass movements, also known as landslides. It's essential to understand these causes, as they hold the key to predicting and potentially mitigating such events.

**Causes that Precede Mass Movements**

- **Removal of Support:** When underlying support for a slope is removed, either by natural processes like erosion or human actions like excavation, the material above loses its stability and becomes prone to collapse. Think of a table missing a leg â€“ instability is inevitable.
    
- **Steeper and Taller Slopes:** Steep slopes naturally have more gravitational force acting on them, increasing their susceptibility to sliding. The higher the slope, the more potential energy the material possesses.
    
- **Overloading:** Adding extra weight to a slope, whether through natural processes like heavy snowfall or human actions like construction, can push it beyond its stability threshold. Imagine overloading a bookshelf - eventually, something has to give way.
    
- **Rain and Lubrication:** Rainwater is a major culprit. It infiltrates the soil, increasing its weight, reducing cohesion between particles, and essentially lubricating the potential slide path. This is equivalent to trying to run on a wet, slippery surface; it compromises stability.
    
- **Removing Load:** Oddly, removing weight from an established slope can also cause issues. If supporting material is suddenly taken away, slopes can readjust, leading to unexpected failures.
    
- **Earthquakes and Vibrations:** Seismic events, explosions, and even heavy machinery vibrations can shake the ground, triggering landslides in vulnerable areas. Imagine a building trembling during an earthquake - the stability is disrupted.
    
- **Excessive Seepage:** When groundwater flow increases excessively, it creates outward pressure within a slope, reducing the internal forces holding it together.
    
- **Water Drawdowns:** Rapid drops in water levels of lakes, reservoirs, or rivers can destabilize neighboring slopes. The water had previously acted as a counterweight; its sudden absence removes that support.
    
- **Loss of Vegetation:** Plant roots hold soil together. Deforestation or other forms of vegetation removal weaken the slope structure, making it more likely to give way.
    

**Types of Movement**

- **Heave:** This describes upward expansion of soil, often due to frost or other swelling processes. This expansion can destabilize slopes from below.
- **Flow:** Think of mudslides or debris flows. Here, the material moves as a fluid mass, often rapidly, due to high water content.
- **Slide:** This involves a cohesive block of material moving along a defined slip surface. Slides can be fast or slow, rotational (like a slump) or translational (moving in a straight-line path).

Understanding these intertwined causes and forms of movement is crucial for landslide hazard assessment and prevention.
