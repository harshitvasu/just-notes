Climate
Climate is an important active factor in soil
formation. The climatic elements involved in
soil development are : (i) moisture in terms of
its intensity, frequency and duration of
precipitation - evaporation and humidity;
(ii) temperature in terms of seasonal and
diurnal variations.
Precipitation gives soil its moisture content
which makes the chemical and biological
activities possible. Excess of water helps in the
downward transportation of soil components
through the soil (eluviation) and deposits the
same down below (illuviation). In climates like
wet equatorial rainy areas with high rainfall,
not only calcium, sodium, magnesium,
potassium etc. but also a major part of silica is
removed from the soil. Removal of silica from
the soil is known as desilication. In dry climates,
because of high temperature, evaporation
exceeds precipitation and hence ground water
is brought up to the surface by capillary action
and in the process the water evaporates leaving
behind salts in the soil. Such salts form into a
crust in the soil known as hardpans. In tropical
climates and in areas with intermediate
precipitation conditions, calcium carbonate
nodules (kanker) are formed.
Temperature acts in two ways — increasing
or reducing chemical and biological activity.
Chemical activity is increased in higher
temperatures, reduced in cooler temperatures
(with an exception of carbonation) and stops
in freezing conditions. That is why, tropical soils
with higher temperatures show deeper profiles
and in the frozen tundra regions soils contain
largely mechanically broken materials.

Climate acts as the master conductor when it comes to soil formation. Let's dive into how rainfall and temperature influence the complex symphony that creates our soils.

**Rainfall: More Than Just Water**

Rainfall provides the essential moisture that allows chemical and biological processes to flourish within the soil. However, its effects go far beyond simple hydration.

- **The Downward Transport:** In areas with heavy rainfall, water doesn't just soak into the soil; it acts as a powerful transportation system. Dissolved minerals, salts, and even silica can be carried downward, a process known as eluviation. The materials removed from the upper layers may later be deposited lower in the soil profile, a process called illuviation.
    
- **Desilication: Intense Weathering:** Extreme rainfall, like that found in wet equatorial regions, strips away not just basic elements, but even silica, the main building block of many minerals. This process is called desilication, leaving behind highly weathered soils.
    
- **Arid Climates: Evaporation's Impact:** In dry regions, evaporation often outpaces rainfall. This draws water upwards through the soil, a process called capillary action. As the water evaporates near the surface, it leaves behind dissolved salts, which can eventually form a hard crust in the soil called a hardpan.
    
- **The Goldilocks Zone:** Climates with moderate rainfall often see the formation of calcium carbonate nodules, also known as kankers. These form as a result of the delicate balance between water movement and mineral concentrations.
    

**Temperature: The Pace of Change**

Temperature directly affects the speed of both chemical and biological processes in the soil. Warmer temperatures generally speed things up. That's why tropical soils tend to develop deep profiles and exhibit extensive weathering. Think of a compost pile – decomposition occurs much faster in the summer heat!

At the other extreme, in frozen tundra regions, the very low temperatures slow or halt processes like decomposition. Here, soils often consist mainly of mechanically weathered rock fragments with little organic content.

**Climate's Signature**

The interplay between climate, parent material, topography, and living organisms creates soils with unique characteristics across the globe. Understanding the role of rainfall and temperature is essential for predicting soil types, their potential fertility, and their vulnerability to erosion or salinization.
