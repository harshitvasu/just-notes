Amaravati Dharanikota became the capital of the Kota chiefs, for the 3rd time in history (12th century). According to an inscription found in a temple at Velpuru in Guntur, Amaravati was described as follows:
“There is a city, named Sri Dhanyakataka, which is superior to the City of the Gods, and where the temple of Sambhu, named Amaresvara, is worshipped by the Lord of the Gods (Indra), where the God Buddha, worshipped by the creator, is quite close by and where there is a very lofty chaitya, well decorated with various sculptures.”, which also reveals that the stupa was in a good state of its existence.

How many of the statements given above are correct?

(a) Only one

(b) Only two

(c) All three

(d) None

Explanation: (b)

Origin of Stupa:

The word Stupa is mentioned in the Rigveda, Atharvaveda, Vajasaneyi Samhita, Taittriya Samhita, in the Panchavimsata Brahmana. Hence, statement 1 is not correct.
Rigveda refers to a Stupa raised by the King Varuna above the forest in a place having no foundation .The word ‘estuka’ is also used in the same sense in Rigveda, probably by then anything raised on the ground like a heap/pile might have been known as Stupa.
The practice of preserving the remains of an important personality below accumulated earth was long in existence. Buddhist art adopted this practice and the structure built over such a site was known as Stupa Hence, Statement 2 is correct.
The Buddhist texts like the Avadana Satakam, Mahavadana and Stupavadanam mentions about the commemorative aspects of the Stupa even the Jaina literature like Raya Pasenaiya Sutta refers to it. Probably in the later period, due to the deep desire of the common mass to worship the lord for the sake of salvation, Stupa acquired its votive character as well. Hence, statement 3 is correct.
Hence, option B is correct.

(a) Buddhism

(b) Jainism

(c) Shaivism

(d) Vaishnavism

Explanation: (b)

As Jains see it, all beings are animated by jiva, the soul.

11. In essence, what does Due Process of Law' mean?

(a) The principle of natural justice

(b) The procedure established by law

(d) Equality before law

Explanation: (c)

The due process of law doctrine examines not only whether a law exists to deprive a person of his or her life and personal liberty, but also whether the legislation is fair, just, and not arbitrary.
Due process of law is a constitutional guarantee that prevents governments from impacting citizens in an abusive way. In its modern form, due process includes both procedural standards that courts must uphold in order to protect peoples’ personal liberty and a range of liberty interests that statutes and regulations must not infringe.
It traces its origins to Chapter 39 of King John’s Magna Carta, which provides that no freeman will be seized, dispossessed of his property, or harmed except “by the law of the land,” an expression that referred to customary practices of the court. The phrase “due process of law” first appeared as a substitute for Magna Carta’s “the law of the land” in a 1354 statute of King Edward III that restated Magna Carta’s guarantee of the liberty of the subject.
Hence, option (c) is correct.

Young marsupials (called joeys) do most of their early development outside of their mother's body, in a pouch.
Marsupials are not naturally found in India. There are over 330 species of marsupials. Around two-thirds of them live in Australia. The other third live mostly in South America, where some interesting ones include the flipper-wearing yapok, bare-tailed woolly opossum. Hence, statement-I is correct.
However, marsupials can thrive in various habitats, not only in montane grasslands with no predators. They can live in any part of the forest habitat.
For example, some marsupials live in rainforests, deserts, woodlands, and savannas. Hence, statement-II is NOT correct.
Therefore, option (c) is correct.

24. Consider the following fauna:

Lion-tailed Macaque
Malabar Civet
Sambar Deer
How many of the above are generally nocturnal or most active after sunset?

(a) Only one

(b) Only two

(c) All three

(d) None

Explanation: (b)

The lion-tailed macaque is not a nocturnal animal. It is an arboreal and diurnal creature, they sleep at night in trees (typically, high in the canopy of rainforest). These macaques are territorial and very communicative animals. Hence, 1 is not correct.
Malabar civet is primarily nocturnal. It is a small, carnivorous mammal that is native to the Western Ghats region of India.
It has a solitary and secretive nature, making it challenging to observe in the wild. Its nocturnal behavior helps it avoid predators and increases its chances of finding prey in the darkness. Hence, 2 is correct.
Sambar deer are nocturnal. They more commonly communicate by scent marking and foot stamping. They prefer the dense cover of deciduous shrubs and grass. Hence, 3 is correct.
Hence, option (b) is correct.

25. Which of the following organisms perform waggle dance for others of their kin to indicate the direction and the distance to a source of their food?

(a) Butterflies

(b) Dragonflies

(c) Honeybees

(d) Wasps

Explanation: (c)

Honeybees perform waggle dance to communicate the location of food sources or new nest sites to their colony mates. Hence, option (c) is correct.
The dance consists of a straight run followed by a loop to one side and then another straight run followed by a loop to the other side, forming a figure-eight pattern. The angle of the straight run relative to gravity indicates the direction of the food source relative to the sun, and the duration of the straight run indicates the distance of the food source from the hive.
Young bees that were isolated from older foragers could perform waggle dance spontaneously, but they made more errors in encoding distance information than bees that had older role models.
This suggests that honeybees learn from observing and practising with experienced dancers before they become proficient foragers themselves. Therefore, honeybees’ waggle dance is both innate and learned, like human language or songbird communication.

26. Consider the following statements:

Some mushrooms have medicinal properties.
Some mushrooms have psycho-active properties.
Some mushrooms have insecticidal properties.
Some mushrooms have bioluminescent properties.
How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one

(b) Only two

(c) Only three

(d) All four

Explanation: (d)

Mushrooms act as antibacterial, immune system enhancer and cholesterol lowering agents; additionally, they are important sources of bioactive compounds. As a result of these properties, some mushroom extracts are used to promote human health and are found as dietary supplements. Hence, statement 1 is correct.
Magic mushrooms (psychoactive fungi) that grow in the United States, Mexico, South America, and many other parts of the world, contain psilocybin and psilocin, which are hallucinogens and are Class I controlled substances. Hence, statement 2 is correct.
Fungi are living things, just like insects are, capable of evolving and adapting. Many synthetic pesticides have lost efficacy over the years because the target insects have just evolved and built-up tolerance to them. But like any other relationship between parasite and host, predator and prey, the fungus-based biopesticides have the ability to evolve right along with any adaptation the insects might come up with to hinder them. They are also nontoxic to humans and other wildlife. Hence, statement 3 is correct.
A mushroom documentation project in the forests of Northeast India has revealed not only 600 varieties of fungi, but also led to a new discovery: a bioluminescent — or light emitting — variety of mushroom. Hence, statement 4 is correct.

How many of the statements given above are correct?

(a) Only one

(b) Only two

(c) All three

(d) None

Explanation: (a)

Wular Lake is the 2nd largest fresh-water lake of Asia. It is sited in the Bandipora district in Jammu and Kashmir, India. Main source of water for Wular Lake is River Jhelum. This lake also has a small island in its centre called the ‘Zaina Lank’. This island was constructed by King Zainul-Abi-Din. Hence, statement 1 is correct.
Wular Lake is also said to be a remnant of Satisar Lake that existed in ancient times. The premises of this lake also form a popular sunset point.
Kolleru, one of the largest freshwater lakes in India, (it was designated a sanctuary in October 1999) is situated between the Krishna and West Godavari districts of the state.
The Krishna River does not directly feed the Kolleru Lake. The Kolleru Lake is fed by two seasonal rivers, Budameru and Tammileru, which are tributaries of the Krishna River. Therefore, the Krishna River indirectly feeds the Kolleru Lake through its tributaries. Hence, statement 2 is NOT correct.
The meandering of Gandak River did not form the Kanwar Lake, which is a freshwater oxbow lake located in Begusarai district of Bihar, India.
The Kanwar Lake was formed by a cut-off meander of an old channel of Burhi Gandak River. The Burhi Gandak River flows parallel to the eastern side of the Gandak River through an old channel. Hence, Statement 3 is NOT correct.

34. Consider the following statements:

India has more arable area than China.
The proportion of irrigated area is more in India as compared to China.
The average productivity per hectare in Indian agriculture is higher than that in China.
How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one

(b) Only two

(c) All three

(d) None

Explanation: (b)

Arable land is the land that can be used for growing crops. Arable land is an important indicator of a country’s agricultural potential and food security.
According to the World Population Review, India has 156.1M Hectares of arable land, which is about 47% of its total land area.
China has 119.5M Hectares of arable land, which is about 12% of its total land area. India has more arable land than China because it has a larger proportion of plains and river basins, which are suitable for cultivation. China has more mountainous and desert regions, which are not suitable for cultivation. Hence, statement 1 is correct.
The proportion of irrigated area is around 48% in India and 40-41% in China. This means that India has a higher percentage of its arable land under irrigation than China.
However, China has invested more in irrigation infrastructure and technology, such as dams, canals, pumps, sprinklers and drip systems, to cope with water scarcity and increase agricultural productivity. India has a large dependence on rainfall and groundwater for irrigation, which are subject to variability and depletion. Hence, statement 2 is correct.
In agriculture, productivity can be measured by the yield per unit area of land, which is the amount of crop produced per hectare or acre.
The average productivity per hectare in Indian agriculture is 2.4 tonnes for rice and 3 tonnes for wheat, while in China it is 6.7 tonnes for rice and 5 tonnes for wheat. Hence, statement 3 is NOT correct.

(d) Statement-I is incorrect but Statement-II is correct

Explanation: (c)

Egypt and Jordan are the only two Arab countries that have formal diplomatic relations with Israel, though some other Arab countries, like Saudi Arabia and Morocco, have reportedly had back-channel communications with it for years. Hence statement 1 is correct.
Since the 1970s Saudi Arabia had exercised a policy of regional coordination among Middle Eastern states, and between them and the United States.
The special position that Saudi Arabia has occupied over the last few decades in Arab-Israeli affairs reflects the Saudi kingdom's role as regional coordinator.
The analysis revolves around the Saudi initiative for peace between Arab parties and Israel in the 1980s ("The Fahd Plan" leading up to "The Fez resolutions"-1981-1982) and in the beginning of the twenty-first century ("The Abdullah initiative" leading up to "The Arab peace initiative", 2002-2007). However, Israel has not officially signed the initiative. Hence statement 2 is not correct.
Some other initiatives are as follows,

Abraham Accord: The Abraham Accord between Israel, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain is mediated by the USA.
It is the first Arab-Israeli peace deal in 26 years.
As per the agreements, the UAE and Bahrain will establish Embassies and exchange ambassadors.
Working together with Israel across a range of sectors, including tourism, trade, healthcare and security.
The Abraham Accords also open the door for Muslims around the world to visit the historic sites in Israel and to peacefully pray at Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, the third holiest site in Islam.
In the Islamic tradition, the Kaaba in Mecca is considered the holiest site, followed by the Prophet's Mosque in Medina, and Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem.
I2U2 Initiative: I2U2 was initially formed in October, 2021 following the Abraham Accords between Israel and the UAE, to deal with issues concerning maritime security, infrastructure and transport in the region.
At that time, it was called the ‘International Forum for Economic Cooperation’.
That was referred to as the ‘West Asian Quad’.

58. In the recent years Chad, Guinea, Mali and Sudan caught the international attention for which one of the following reasons common to all of them?

(a) Discovery of rich deposits of rare earth elements

(b) Establishment of Chinese military bases

(c) Southward expansion of Sahara Desert

(d) Successful coups

Explanation: (d)

In the last couple of years, Africans witnessed a series of military coups. Most of the recent military takeovers have taken place in West Africa, but the trend threatens to spread wider.
In West Africa, the cycle of coups began in Chad. Mali has witnessed two military coups within a span of 18 months. The last coup took place in August 2020.
In 2021, the military in Sudan ended its uneasy cohabitation with the civilian government by staging a coup.
In 2021, the Guinean military’s overthrow of President Alpha Condé was an outcome of autocratic overreach, economic mismanagement, and eroding democratic norms which points to the failure of regional bodies and international partners to anticipate and respond to an evolving coup playbook.
Hence, for their successful coup, they are in the news. Hence option (d) is correct.

59. Consider the following heavy industries:

Fertilizer plants
Oil refineries
Steel plants
Green hydrogen is expected to play a significant role in decarbonizing how many of the above industries?

(a) Only one

(b) Only two

(c) All three

(d) None

Explanation: (c)

Green Hydrogen:

Hydrogen is a key industrial fuel that has a variety of applications including the production of ammonia (a key fertiliser), steel, refineries and electricity.
However, all of the hydrogen manufactured now is the so-called ‘black or brown’ hydrogen because they are produced from coal.
But when electric current is passed through water, it splits it into elemental oxygen and hydrogen through electrolysis. And if the electricity used for this process comes from a renewable source like wind or solar then the hydrogen thus produced is referred to as green hydrogen.
Need for Producing Green Hydrogen:

Green hydrogen in particular is one of the cleanest sources of energy with close to zero emission. It can be used in fuel cells for cars or in energy-guzzling industries like fertilizers and steel manufacturing.
Green Hydrogen can aid the desulfurisation of crude oil, without the output of CO2 into the atmosphere hence it can provide a clean, on-site green hydrogen supply which will decarbonise the refining process and reduce emissions.
Hence option (c) is correct.

73. Consider the following statements :

Statement-I : The soil in tropical rain forests is rich in nutrients.
Statement-II : The high temperature and moisture of tropical rain forests cause dead organic matter in the soil to decompose quickly.
Which one of the following is correct in respect of the above statements?

(a) Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct and Statement-II is the correct explanation for Statement-I

(b) Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct and Statement-II is not the correct explanation for Statement-I

(c) Statement-I is correct but Statement-II is incorrect

(d) Statement-I is incorrect but Statement-II is correct

Explanation: (d)

Contrary to the belief that all that vegetation, warmth, and moisture that the soil must be very rich, the soil in tropical rainforests is very poor. Hence, statement 1 is not correct.
The high temperature and moisture of tropical rainforests cause dead organic matter in the soil to decompose more quickly than in other climates, thus releasing and losing its nutrients rapidly.
The high volume of rain in tropical rainforests washes nutrients out of the soil more quickly than in other climates. Hence, statement 2 is correct.
If the soil is so poor in tropical rainforests, how does such a dense array of shrubs and trees grow there? - On the ground of the rainforest, there is a thick layer of quickly decaying plants and animals. Nutrients are washed by the heavy rains almost directly from the rotting surface material into the trees without entering the soil much.

(b) Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct and Statement-II is not the correct explanation for Statement-I

(c) Statement-I is correct but Statement-II is incorrect

(d) Statement-I is incorrect but Statement-II is correct

Explanation: (a)

The specific heat is the property of a substance which determines the change in the temperature of the substance (undergoing no phase change) when a given quantity of heat is absorbed (or rejected) by it.
Water has about four times higher heat capacity than land, i.e. it takes much more energy to increase the water temperature and the water temperature will therefore respond slower to temperature changes. Hence, statement 2 is correct.
For places with relatively well-defined seasons like India and Northern Europe, this will mean a large difference in water and land temperatures especially during the late spring/early summer and late autumn/early winter. Hence, statement 2 is correct.
Therefore, both Statement I and Statement II are correct and Statement II is the correct explanation of Statement I.

75. Consider the following statements:

In a seismograph, P waves are recorded earlier than S waves.
In P waves, the individual particles vibrate to and fro in the direction of wave propagation whereas in S waves, the particles vibrate up and down at right angles to the direction of wave propagation.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only

(b) 2 only

(c) Both 1 and 2

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

Explanation: (c)

When an earthquake occurs, two main types of vibratory waves move through the body of the earth from the point of fracture. The primary, or P, waves travel most quickly and are the first to be registered by the seismograph. Secondary, or S, waves travel more slowly. Hence, statement 1 is correct.
As S waves have a greater amplitude than P waves the two groups are easily distinguishable on the seismogram.
Seismic P waves are also called compressional or longitudinal waves, they compress and expand (oscillate) the ground back and forth (to and fro) in the direction of travel, like sound waves.
Particle motion is parallel to the direction of propagation (longitudinal). Material returns to its original shape after the wave passes.
The S waves in an earthquake are examples of Transverse waves.
In a transverse wave the particle displacement is perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. The particles do not move along with the wave; they simply oscillate up and down about their individual equilibrium positions as the wave passes by. Pick a single particle and watch its motion. Hence, statement 2 is correct.

77. ‘Wolbachia method’ is sometimes talked about with reference to which one of the following?

(a) Controlling the viral diseases spread by mosquitoes

(b) Converting crop residues into packing material

(c) Producing biodegradable plastics

(d) Producing biochar from thermo-chemical conversion of biomass

Explanation: (a)

Wolbachia are natural bacteria present in up to 60% of insect species, including some mosquitoes. Wolbachia bacteria cannot make people or animals (for example, fish, birds, pets) sick.
For many years, scientists have been studying Wolbachia, looking for ways to use it to potentially control the mosquitoes that transmit human viruses.
The World Mosquito Program’s Wolbachia Method:
The WMP's field teams release male and female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes with Wolbachia over a number of weeks. These mosquitoes then breed with the wild mosquito population. Over time, the percentage of mosquitoes carrying Wolbachia grows until it remains high without the need for further releases. Mosquitoes with Wolbachia have a reduced ability to transmit viruses to people, decreasing the risk of Zika, dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever outbreaks.
Hence, option (a) is correct.

78. Consider the following activities :

Spreading finely ground basalt rock on farmlands extensively
Increasing the alkalinity of oceans by adding lime
Capturing carbon dioxide released by various industries and pumping it into abandoned subterranean mines in the form of carbonated waters
How many of the above activities are often considered and discussed for carbon capture and sequestration?

(a) Only one

(b) Only two

(c) All three

(d) None

Explanation: (c)

Carbon sequestration is both a natural and artificial process by which carbon dioxide is removed from the Earth’s atmosphere and then stored in liquid or solid form.
Ground basalt has been used as mineral fertiliser since the early thirties. Ground basalt captures CO2 from the atmosphere and the soil pore space, raises the soil pH and reduces ocean acidification. One tonne of basalt captures 0.153–0.165 tonne CO2, depending on infiltration rate.
Ground basalt added to agricultural fertiliser captures atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), raises the soil pH, reduces ocean acidification and supplies important nutrients such as magnesium, potassium, calcium, iron and phosphorus. Hence, 1 is correct.
Oceans absorb about 25% of the carbon dioxide emitted through human activities each year.
As such, the polar regions absorb more carbon dioxide and by 2100, most of the global oceans are expected to be made up of carbon dioxide, potentially altering the chemistry of the ocean, making it more acidic.
Since carbon makes ocean acidic, increasing alkalinity of oceans would help in carbon sequestration. Hence, 2 is correct.
In carbon capture and storage (CCS) processes, carbon dioxide is first separated from other gases contained in industrial emissions.
It is then compressed and transported to a location that is isolated from the atmosphere for long-term storage.
Suitable storage locations might include geologic formations such as deep saline formations (sedimentary rocks whose pore spaces are saturated with water containing high concentrations of dissolved salts), depleted oil and gas reservoirs, or the deep ocean. Hence, 3 is correct.

(b) Understanding the genetic makeup of avian species of a habitat

(c) Using air-bome devices to collect blood samples from moving animals

(d) Sending drones to inaccessible areas to collect plant and animal samples from land surfaces and water bodies

Explanation: (a)

Metagenomics is the study of the structure and function of entire nucleotide sequences isolated and analysed from all the organisms (typically microbes) in a bulk sample.
Metagenomics is often used to study a specific community of microorganisms, such as those residing on human skin, in the soil or in a water sample.
Aerial metagenomics is a scientific field that involves studying the genetic material present in the air, specifically the DNA and RNA of microorganisms suspended in the atmosphere.
It focuses on the analysis of the microbial communities or microbiomes found in the air samples collected from various environments such as outdoor air, indoor air, and airborne particles.
Hence, option A is correct.

(a) Studying the evolutionary relationships among various species of fauna

(b) Stimulating ‘stem cells’ to transform into diverse functional tissues

(c) Promoting clonal propagation of horticultural plants

(d) Assessing the efficacy of drugs by conducting series of drug trials in a population

Explanation: (a/d)

Microsatellite, as related to genomics, refers to a short segment of DNA, usually one to six or more base pairs in length, that is repeated multiple times in succession at a particular genomic location.
These DNA sequences are typically non-coding.
They are useful in providing valuable insights into disease prevalence, the discovery of new genes related to rare diseases, improved diagnostic methods, and the development of novel drugs for these diseases.
Hence, option (a/d) is correct.

Carbon fibres once used cannot be recycled.
Which of the statements give above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only

(b) 2 only

(c) Both 1 and 2

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

Explanation: (a)

Carbon Fibre:

Carbon fiber is composed of carbon atoms bonded together to form a long chain. The fibers are extremely stiff, strong, and light, and are used in many processes to create excellent building materials.
Characteristics and Applications of Carbon Fibers
1. Physical strength, specific toughness, light weight	Aerospace, road and marine transport, sporting goods
2. High dimensional stability, low coefficient of thermal expansion, and low abrasion	Missiles, aircraft brakes, aerospace antenna and support structure, large telescopes, optical benches, waveguides for stable highfrequency (GHz) precision measurement frames
3. Good vibration damping, strength, and toughness	Audio equipment, loudspeakers for Hi-fi equipment, pickup arms, robot arms
4. Electrical conductivity	Automobile hoods, novel tooling, casings and bases for electronic equipments, EMI and RF shielding, brushes
5. Biological inertness and x-ray permeability	Medical applications in prostheses, surgery and x-ray equipment, implants, tendon/ligament repair
6. Fatigue resistance, self- lubrication, high damping	Textile machinery, genera engineering
7. Chemical inertness, high corrosion resistance	Chemical industry: nuclear field; valves, seals, and pump components in process plants
8. Electromagnetic properties	Large generator retaining rings, radiological equipment
Hence, statement 1 is correct.
Carbon fibre is environmentally friendly and exhibits a longer life cycle. However, carbon fibre consumes almost 14 times more energy in its creation compared with steel. This significant energy intensiveness has led to huge emissions of greenhouse gases.
Therefore, the recycling process could be one of the best ways to reduce this environmental impact while meeting global demand for this material in industrial applications.
Currently, carbon fibre waste or other fibre composites can be recycled using four types of technologies. Hence, statement 2 is not correct.

Detection of car crash/collision which results in the deployment of airbags almost instantaneously.
Detection of accidental free fall of a laptop towards the ground which results in the immediate turning off of the hard drive
Detection of the tit of smartphone which results in the rotation of display between portrait and landscape mode
In how many of the above action is the function of accelerometer required?

(a) Only one

(b) Only two

(c) All three

(d) None

Explanation: (c)

Functions of Accelerometer:

The accelerometer detects signals that are used to identify major vehicle crash/collisions. Hence, statement 1 is correct.
The application of accelerometers extends to multiple disciplines, both academic and consumer-driven.
For example, accelerometers in laptops protect hard drives from damage. If the laptop were to suddenly drop while in use, the accelerometer would detect the sudden free fall and immediately turn off the hard drive to avoid hitting the reading heads into the hard drive platter. Hence, statement 2 is correct.
Accelerometers allow the user to understand the surroundings of an item better.
For example, smartphones rotate their display between portrait and landscape mode depending on how you tilt the phone. Hence, statement 3 is correct.

85. With reference to the role of biofilters in Recirculating Aquaculture System, consider the following statements :

Biofilters provide waste treatment by removing uneaten fish feed.
Biofilters convert ammonia present in fish waste to nitrate.
Biofilters increase phosphorus as nutrient for fish in water.
How many of the statements given above are correct?

(a) Only one

(b) Only two

(c) All three

(d) None

Explanation: (b)

Role of Biofilters in Recirculating Aquaculture System (RAS):

RAS biofilters act to remove nitrogenous waste byproducts generated by fish protein catabolism and oxidation processes. Hence, statement 1 is correct.
RAS typically employ a biofilter to control ammonia levels produced as a byproduct of fish protein catabolism.
Ammonia is removed from an aquarium system through the use of a biofilter. The biofilter provides a substrate on which nitrifying bacteria grow. These nitrifying bacteria consume ammonia and produce nitrite, which is also toxic to fish.
Other nitrifying bacteria in the biofilter consume nitrite and produce nitrate. Hence, statement 2 is correct.
The biofilter system reduces the concentration of nitrite, nitrate, phosphorus, and ammonium ions from the synthetic water. Hence, statement 3 is not correct.

92. With reference to Central Bank digital currencies, consider the following statements :

It is possible to make payments in a digital currency without using US dollar or SWIFT system.
A digital currency can be distributed with condition programmed into it such as a time-frame for spending it.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only

(b) 2 only

(c) Both 1 and 2

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

Explanation: (c)

Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is a digital form of currency notes issued by a central bank. Here payments in a digital currency are without using the US dollar or SWIFT system. Hence, statement 1 is correct.
CBDC can be classified into two broad types viz. general purpose or retail (CBDC-R) and wholesale (CBDC-W).
Retail CBDC would be potentially available for use by all viz. private sector, non-financial consumers and businesses while wholesale CBDC is designed for restricted access to select financial institutions.
While Wholesale CBDC is intended for the settlement of interbank transfers and related wholesale transactions, Retail CBDC is an electronic version of cash primarily meant for retail transactions.
Programmability: One interesting application of CBDC is the technical possibility of programmability. CBDCs have the possibility of programming the money by tying the end use. For example, agriculture credit by banks can be programmed to ensure that it is used only at input store outlets.
However, the programmability feature of CBDC needs to be carefully examined in order to retain the essential features of a currency. It can also have other implications for monetary policy transmission as tokens may have an expiry date, by which they would need to be spent, thus ensuring consumption. Hence, statement 2 is correct.
The programmability of tokens can be achieved using the following:
Smart contracts: Business rules are stored as code that is executed during transactions to verify that the token is being used correctly.
Token version: The version of the token can be tightly linked to the technical code class. The alternative is that the version is stored as a token data field.

93. In the context of finance, the term ‘beta’ refers to

(a) the process of simultaneous buying and selling of an asset from different platforms

(b) an investment strategy of a portfolio manager to balance risk versus reward

(c) a type of systemic risk that arises where perfect hedging is not possible

(d) a numeric value that measures the fluctuations of a stock to changes in the overall stock market.

Explanation: (d)

In the context of finance, the term ‘beta’ refers to a measure of how an individual asset moves (on average) when the overall stock market increases or decreases. It is used as a measure of risk and is an integral part of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). A company with a higher beta has greater risk and also greater expected returns. The beta coefficient can be interpreted as follows:
β =1 exactly as volatile as the market
β >1 more volatile than the market
β <1>0 less volatile than the market
β =0 uncorrelated to the market
β <0 negatively correlated to the market2
The beta coefficient can be calculated by dividing the product of the covariance of the security’s returns and the market’s returns by the variance of the market’s returns over a specified period
A type of systemic risk that arises where perfect hedging is not possible is called basis risk.
An investment strategy of a portfolio manager to balance risk versus reward is called asset allocation.
The process of simultaneous buying and selling of an asset from different platforms, exchanges or locations to cash in on the price difference is called arbitrage.
A numeric value that measures the fluctuations of a stock to changes in the overall stock market is called beta. Hence, option (d) is correct.

The Regional Rural Banks and Scheduled Commercial Banks support SHGs.
How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one

(b) Only two

(c) All three

(d) None

Explanation: (b)

Self-Help Group or in-short SHG is now a well-known concept. It is now almost two decade old. It is reported that the SHGs have a role in hastening country’s economic development. SHGs have now evolved as a movement. We can trace the origin of the concept of SHGs in Bangladesh (Dr. Mehmud Yunus). India has adopted the Bangladesh’s model in a modified form.
In 1970, Ilaben Bhat, founder member of ‘SEWA’(Self Employed Women’s Association) in Ahmadabad, had developed a concept of ‘women and micro-finance’. The Annapurna Mahila Mandal’ in Maharashtra and ‘Working Women’s Forum’ in Tamilnadu and many National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD)- sponsored groups have followed the path laid down by ‘SEWA’.
In 1991-92 NABARD started promoting self-help groups on a large scale. And it was the real take-off point for the ‘SHG movement’. In 1993, the Reserve Bank of India also allowed SHGs to open saving accounts in banks. Hence, statement 1 is not correct.
Such groups work as a collective guarantee system formembers who propose to borrow from organised sources. The poor collect their savings and save it in banks. In return they receive easy access to loans with a small rate of interest to start their micro unit enterprise. Hence, statement 2 is correct.
Table 2 : Pattern of Partnership
