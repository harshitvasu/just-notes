Money serves as a store of value, allowing individuals to save their wealth for future use. Unlike perishable goods or assets with fluctuating values, money generally retains its purchasing power over time. For example, a person earning a salary today can save a portion of it in a bank account, confident that it will still have value when they need to purchase goods or services in the future.

However, money is dynamic in nature. Its purchasing power can fluctuate due to factors like inflation, which erodes the value of money over time. For instance, if the price of apples doubles, the purchasing power of a dollar is halved in terms of apples. This dynamism necessitates careful financial planning and investment strategies to preserve and grow wealth.

Technological advancements have led to the rise of cashless transactions. Digital payment systems like mobile wallets, online banking, and card payments are increasingly replacing physical cash. Governments and financial institutions are promoting financial inclusion through initiatives like Jan Dhan accounts in India, which provide access to banking services for the unbanked population. These advancements enhance the efficiency and convenience of financial transactions while reducing the reliance on physical currency.
