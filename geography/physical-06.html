their evolution</h2>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>After <strong>weathering processes</strong> have had their actions on
the <strong>earth materials</strong> making up the surface of the earth,
the <strong>geomorphic agents</strong> like <strong>running
water</strong>, <strong>ground water</strong>, <strong>wind</strong>,
<strong>glaciers</strong>, <strong>waves</strong> perform
<strong>erosion</strong>. It is already known to you that erosion causes
changes on the surface of the earth. <strong>Deposition</strong> follows
erosion and because of deposition too, changes occur on the surface of
the earth.</p>
<p>As this chapter deals with <strong>landforms</strong> and their
<strong>evolution</strong>, ‘first’ start with the question, what is a
landform? In simple words, <strong>small to medium tracts or
parcels</strong> of the earth’s surface are called landforms. Several
related landforms together make up <strong>landscapes</strong> (large
tracts of earth’s surface). Each landform has its own physical
<strong>shape, size, materials</strong> and is a result of the action of
certain <strong>geomorphic processes</strong> and
<strong>agent(s)</strong>. Actions of most of the geomorphic processes
and agents are <strong>slow</strong>, and hence the results take a long
time to take shape. Every landform has a beginning. Landforms once
formed may change in their <strong>shape, size, and nature</strong>
slowly or fast due to continued action of geomorphic processes and
agents.</p>
<p>Due to changes in <strong>climatic conditions</strong> and
<strong>vertical or horizontal movements</strong> of
<strong>landmasses</strong>, either the intensity of processes or the
processes themselves might change leading to new modifications in the
landforms. <strong>Evolution</strong> here implies <strong>stages of
transformation</strong> of either a part of the earth’s surface from one
landform into another or transformation of individual landforms after
they are once formed. That means, each and every landform has a
<strong>history of development</strong> and <strong>changes through
time</strong>. A landmass passes through <strong>stages of
development</strong> somewhat comparable to the stages of life —
<strong>youth, mature and old age</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="running-water">RUNNING WATER</h3>
<p>In <strong>humid regions</strong>, which receive <strong>heavy
rainfall</strong>, <strong>running water</strong> is considered the most
important of the <strong>geomorphic agents</strong> in bringing about
the <strong>degradation of the land surface</strong>. There are two
components of running water. One is <strong>overland flow</strong> on
general land surface as a sheet. Another is <strong>linear flow</strong>
as streams and rivers in valleys. Most of the <strong>erosional
landforms</strong> made by running water are associated with
<strong>vigorous and youthful rivers</strong> flowing over <strong>steep
gradients</strong>.</p>
<p>With time, <strong>stream channels</strong> over steep gradients turn
gentler due to continued erosion, and as a consequence, lose their
velocity, facilitating active <strong>deposition</strong>. There may be
depositional forms associated with streams flowing over steep slopes.
But these phenomena will be on a small scale compared to those
associated with <strong>rivers flowing over medium to gentle
slopes</strong>. The gentler the river channels in gradient or slope,
the greater is the deposition. When the stream beds turn gentler due to
continued erosion, <strong>downward cutting</strong> becomes less
dominant and <strong>lateral erosion</strong> of banks increases and as
a consequence the <strong>hills and valleys</strong> are reduced to
<strong>plains</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Youth</strong> Streams are few during this stage with
<strong>poor integration</strong> and flow over original slopes showing
<strong>shallow V-shaped valleys</strong> with no floodplains or with
very narrow floodplains along trunk streams. <strong>Stream
divides</strong> are broad and flat with <strong>marshes, swamps, and
lakes</strong>. Meanders, if present, develop over these broad upland
surfaces. These meanders may eventually entrench themselves into the
uplands. <strong>Waterfalls</strong> and <strong>rapids</strong> may
exist where local hard rock bodies are exposed.</p>
<p><strong>Mature</strong> During this stage streams are plenty with
<strong>good integration</strong>. The valleys are still V-shaped but
deep; trunk streams are broad enough to have <strong>wider
floodplains</strong> within which streams may flow in meanders confined
within the valley. The flat and broad inter-stream areas and swamps and
marshes of youth disappear and the <strong>stream divides turn
sharp</strong>. Waterfalls and rapids disappear.</p>
<p><strong>Old</strong> Smaller tributaries during old age are few with
<strong>gentle gradients</strong>. Streams meander freely over
<strong>vast floodplains</strong> showing <strong>natural
levees</strong>, <strong>oxbow lakes</strong>, etc. Divides are broad
and flat with <strong>lakes, swamps, and marshes</strong>. Most of the
landscape is at or slightly above sea level.</p>
<h3 id="erosional-landforms"><strong>EROSIONAL LANDFORMS</strong></h3>
<h4 id="valleys"><strong>Valleys</strong></h4>
<p>Valleys start as small and narrow <strong>rills</strong>; the rills
will gradually develop into long and wide <strong>gullies</strong>; the
gullies will further deepen, widen and lengthen to give rise to valleys.
Depending upon dimensions and shape, many types of valleys like
<strong>V-shaped valley</strong>, <strong>gorge</strong>,
<strong>canyon</strong>, etc. can be recognized. A gorge is a deep
valley with very steep to straight sides and a canyon is characterized
by steep step-like side slopes and may be as deep as a gorge. A gorge is
almost equal in width at its top as well as its bottom. In contrast, a
canyon is wider at its top than at its bottom. In fact, a canyon is a
variant of gorge. <strong>Valley types</strong> depend upon the type and
structure of rocks in which they form. For example, canyons commonly
form in <strong>horizontal bedded sedimentary rocks</strong> and gorges
form in <strong>hard rocks</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="potholes-and-plunge-pools"><strong>Potholes and Plunge
Pools</strong></h4>
<p>Over the <strong>rocky beds of hill-streams</strong>, more or less
<strong>circular depressions</strong> called potholes form because of
<strong>stream erosion</strong> aided by the <strong>abrasion of rock
fragments</strong>. Once a small and shallow depression forms,
<strong>pebbles and boulders</strong> get collected in those depressions
and get rotated by flowing water, and consequently, the depressions grow
in dimensions. A series of such depressions eventually join, and the
<strong>stream valley</strong> gets deepened. At the foot of
<strong>waterfalls</strong>, large potholes, quite deep and wide, form
because of the sheer impact of water and the rotation of boulders. Such
large and deep holes at the base of waterfalls are called <strong>plunge
pools</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="incised-or-entrenched-meanders"><strong>Incised or Entrenched
Meanders</strong></h4>
<p>In streams that flow rapidly over <strong>steep gradients</strong>,
normally <strong>erosion</strong> is concentrated on the <strong>bottom
of the stream channel</strong>. Also, in the case of steep gradient
streams, <strong>lateral erosion</strong> on the sides of the valleys is
not much when compared to the streams flowing on low and gentle slopes.
Because of active lateral erosion, streams flowing over gentle slopes
develop <strong>sinuous or meandering courses</strong>. It is common to
find meandering courses over <strong>floodplains</strong> and
<strong>delta plains</strong> where stream gradients are very gentle.
But very deep and wide meanders can also be found cut in <strong>hard
rocks</strong>. Such meanders are called <strong>incised or entrenched
meanders</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="depositional-landforms">DEPOSITIONAL LANDFORMS</h2>
<h3 id="alluvial-fans"><strong>Alluvial Fans</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Alluvial fans</strong> are formed when <strong>streams
flowing from higher levels</strong> break into <strong>foot slope
plains</strong> of low gradient. Normally, very <strong>coarse
load</strong> is carried by streams flowing over <strong>mountain
slopes</strong>. This load becomes too heavy for the streams to be
carried over gentler gradients and gets dumped and spread as a broad low
to high <strong>cone-shaped deposit</strong> called an alluvial fan.
Usually, the streams which flow over fans are not confined to their
original channels for long and shift their position across the fan,
forming many channels called <strong>distributaries</strong>. Alluvial
fans in humid areas show normally <strong>low cones with gentle
slope</strong> from head to toe, and they appear as <strong>high cones
with steep slopes</strong> in arid and semi-arid climates.</p>
<h3 id="deltas"><strong>Deltas</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Deltas</strong> are like <strong>alluvial fans</strong> but
develop at a different location. The load carried by the rivers is
dumped and spread into the <strong>sea</strong>. If this load is not
carried away far into the sea or distributed along the coast, it spreads
and accumulates as a <strong>low cone</strong>. Unlike in alluvial fans,
the deposits making up deltas are very well <strong>sorted</strong> with
clear <strong>stratification</strong>. The coarsest materials settle out
first and the finer fractions like <strong>silts and clays</strong> are
carried out into the sea. As the delta grows, the <strong>river
distributaries</strong> continue to increase in length, and the delta
continues to build up into the sea.</p>
<h3 id="floodplains-natural-levees-and-point-bars"><strong>Floodplains,
Natural Levees, and Point Bars</strong></h3>
<p>Deposition develops a <strong>floodplain</strong> just as erosion
makes valleys. A floodplain is a major landform of <strong>river
deposition</strong>. Large-sized materials are deposited first when the
stream channel breaks into a gentle slope. Thus, normally, fine-sized
materials like <strong>sand, silt, and clay</strong> are carried by
relatively slow-moving waters in gentler channels usually found in the
plains and deposited over the bed and when the waters spill over the
banks during flooding above the bed.</p>
<hr />
<p>A <strong>river bed</strong> made of river deposits is the active
floodplain. The floodplain above the bank is the inactive floodplain.
Inactive floodplains above the banks basically contain two types of
deposits — <strong>flood deposits</strong> and <strong>channel
deposits</strong>. In plains, channels shift laterally and change their
courses occasionally, leaving cut-off courses which get filled up
gradually. Such areas over floodplains built up by abandoned or cut-off
channels contain coarse deposits. The flood deposits of spilled waters
carry relatively finer materials like silt and clay. The floodplains in
a delta are called <strong>delta plains</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Natural levees</strong> and <strong>point bars</strong> are
some of the important landforms found associated with floodplains.
Natural levees are found along the banks of large rivers. They are low,
linear, and parallel <strong>ridges of coarse deposits</strong> along
the banks of rivers, quite often cut into individual mounds. Point bars,
also known as <strong>meander bars</strong>, are found on the concave
side of meanders of large rivers and are sediments deposited in a linear
fashion by flowing waters along the bank. They are almost uniform in
profile and in width and contain mixed sizes of sediments.</p>
<h3 id="meanders"><strong>Meanders</strong></h3>
<p>In large <strong>flood</strong> and <strong>delta plains</strong>,
rivers rarely flow in straight courses. <strong>Loop-like channel
patterns</strong> called meanders develop over flood and delta plains. A
meander is not a landform but is only a type of channel pattern. This is
because of:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li><strong>Propensity of water</strong> flowing over very gentle
gradients to work laterally on the banks;<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Unconsolidated nature of alluvial deposits</strong> making
up the banks with many irregularities which can be used by water
exerting pressure laterally;<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Coriolis force</strong> acting on the fluid water deflecting
it like it deflects the wind.</li>
</ol>
<p>When the gradient of the channel becomes extremely low, water flows
leisurely and starts working laterally. Slight <strong>irregularities
along the banks</strong> slowly get transformed into a small curvature
in the banks; the curvature deepens due to <strong>deposition</strong>
on the inside of the curve and <strong>erosion</strong> along the bank
on the outside. If there is no deposition and no erosion or
undercutting, the tendency to meander is reduced. Normally, in meanders
of large rivers, there is active deposition along the <strong>concave
bank</strong> and undercutting along the <strong>convex bank</strong>.
The concave bank is known as the <strong>cut-off bank</strong>, which
shows up as a steep scarp, and the convex bank presents a long, gentle
profile. As meanders grow into deep loops, they may get cut off due to
erosion at the inflection points and are left as <strong>ox-bow
lakes</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="groundwater"><strong>GROUNDWATER</strong></h3>
<p>Here the interest is not on groundwater as a resource. Our focus is
on the <strong>work of groundwater</strong> in the <strong>erosion of
landmasses</strong> and <strong>evolution of landforms</strong>. The
<strong>surface water</strong> percolates well when the rocks are
<strong>permeable, thinly bedded, and highly jointed and
cracked</strong>. After vertically going down to some depth, the water
under the ground flows <strong>horizontally</strong> through the
<strong>bedding planes, joints, or through the materials
themselves</strong>. It is this downward and horizontal movement of
water which causes the rocks to erode.</p>
<p><strong>Physical or mechanical removal</strong> of materials by
moving groundwater is insignificant in developing landforms. That is why
the results of the work of groundwater cannot be seen in all types of
rocks. But in rocks like <strong>limestones or dolomites</strong> rich
in <strong>calcium carbonate</strong>, the surface water as well as
groundwater through the <strong>chemical process of solution</strong>
and <strong>precipitation deposition</strong> develop varieties of
landforms. These two processes of solution and precipitation are active
in limestones or dolomites occurring either exclusively or interbedded
with other rocks.</p>
<p>Any limestone or dolomitic region showing typical landforms produced
by the action of groundwater through the processes of solution and
deposition is called <strong>Karst topography</strong> after the typical
topography developed in limestone rocks of the <strong>Karst
region</strong> in the Balkans adjacent to the <strong>Adriatic
Sea</strong>. The karst topography is also characterized by
<strong>erosional and depositional landforms</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="erosional-landforms-1"><strong>EROSIONAL LANDFORMS</strong></h2>
<h3 id="pools-sinkholes-lapies-and-limestone-pavements"><strong>Pools,
Sinkholes, Lapies, and Limestone Pavements</strong></h3>
<p>Small to medium-sized round to sub-rounded shallow depressions called
<strong>swallow holes</strong> form on the surface of
<strong>limestones</strong> through solution. <strong>Sinkholes</strong>
are very common in <strong>limestone/karst areas</strong>. A sinkhole is
an opening more or less circular at the top and funnel-shaped towards
the bottom, with sizes varying in area from a few sq. m to a hectare and
with depth from less than half a meter to thirty meters or more. Some of
these form solely through <strong>solution action</strong> (solution
sinks), and others might start as solution forms first and if the bottom
of a sinkhole forms the roof of a void or cave underground, it might
collapse, leaving a large hole opening into a cave or a void below
(<strong>collapse sinks</strong>). Quite often, sinkholes are covered up
with soil mantle and appear as shallow <strong>water pools</strong>.
Anybody stepping over such pools would go down like it happens in
quicksands in deserts. The term <strong>doline</strong> is sometimes
used to refer to collapse sinks. Solution sinks are more common than
collapse sinks.</p>
<p>Quite often, the surface runoff simply goes down swallow and
sinkholes and flows as <strong>underground streams</strong> and
reemerges at a distance downstream through a cave opening. When
sinkholes and dolines join together because of slumping of materials
along their margins or due to roof collapse of caves, long, narrow to
wide trenches called <strong>valley sinks or Uvalas</strong> form.
Gradually, most of the surface of the limestone is eaten away by these
pits and trenches, leaving it extremely irregular with a maze of points,
grooves, and ridges or <strong>lapies</strong>. Especially, these ridges
or lapies form due to differential solution activity along parallel to
sub-parallel joints. The lapie field may eventually turn into somewhat
smooth <strong>limestone pavements</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="caves"><strong>Caves</strong></h3>
<p>In areas where there are <strong>alternating beds of rocks</strong>
(shales, sandstones, quartzites) with <strong>limestones or
dolomites</strong> in between or in areas where limestones are
<strong>dense, massive, and occurring as thick beds</strong>, cave
formation is prominent. <strong>Water percolates down</strong> either
through the materials or through <strong>cracks and joints</strong> and
moves horizontally along <strong>bedding planes</strong>. It is along
these bedding planes that the limestone dissolves and long and narrow to
wide gaps called <strong>caves</strong> result. There can be a
<strong>maze of caves</strong> at different elevations depending upon
the limestone beds and intervening rocks. Caves normally have an opening
through which <strong>cave streams</strong> are discharged. Caves having
openings at both ends are called <strong>tunnels</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="stalactites-stalagmites-and-pillars"><strong>Stalactites,
Stalagmites, and Pillars</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Stalactites</strong> hang as icicles of different diameters.
Normally, they are broad at their bases and taper towards the free ends,
showing up in a variety of forms. <strong>Stalagmites</strong> rise up
from the floor of the caves. In fact, stalagmites form due to dripping
water from the surface or through the thin pipe of the stalactite,
immediately below it.</p>
<p>Stalagmites may take the shape of a column, a disc, with either a
smooth, rounded bulging end or a miniature crater-like depression. The
stalagmite and stalactites eventually fuse to give rise to
<strong>columns</strong> and <strong>pillars</strong> of different
diameters.</p>
<h3 id="glaciers"><strong>GLACIERS</strong></h3>
<p>Masses of ice moving as sheets over the land (<strong>continental
glacier</strong> or <strong>piedmont glacier</strong> if a vast sheet of
ice is spread over the plains at the foot of mountains) or as linear
flows down the slopes of mountains in broad trough-like valleys
(<strong>mountain and valley glaciers</strong>) are called glaciers. The
movement of glaciers is slow, unlike water flow. The movement could be a
few centimeters to a few meters a day or even less or more. Glaciers
move basically because of the <strong>force of gravity</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Erosion by glaciers</strong> is tremendous because of
<strong>friction caused by the sheer weight of the ice</strong>. The
material plucked from the land by glaciers (usually large-sized angular
blocks and fragments) gets dragged along the floors or sides of the
valleys and cause great damage through <strong>abrasion and
plucking</strong>. Glaciers can cause significant damage to even
un-weathered rocks and can reduce high mountains into low hills and
plains.</p>
<p>As glaciers continue to move, debris gets removed, divides get
lowered, and eventually the slope is reduced to such an extent that
glaciers will stop moving, leaving only a mass of <strong>low
hills</strong> and vast <strong>outwash plains</strong> along with other
depositional features.</p>
<h2 id="erosional-landforms-2"><strong>EROSIONAL LANDFORMS</strong></h2>
<h3 id="cirque"><strong>Cirque</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Cirques</strong> are the most common landforms in
<strong>glaciated mountains</strong>. The cirques are often found at the
heads of <strong>glacial valleys</strong>. The accumulated ice cuts
these cirques while moving down the mountain tops. They are
<strong>deep, long, and wide troughs or basins</strong> with very steep
concave to vertically dropping high walls at its head as well as sides.
A lake of water can be seen quite often within the cirques after the
glacier disappears. Such lakes are called <strong>cirque</strong> or
<strong>tarn lakes</strong>. There can be two or more cirques, one
leading into another down below in a stepped sequence.</p>
<h3 id="horns-and-serrated-ridges"><strong>Horns and Serrated
Ridges</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Horns</strong> form through <strong>headward erosion</strong>
of the cirque walls. If three or more radiating glaciers cut headward
until their cirques meet, high, sharp-pointed, and steep-sided peaks
called horns form. The divides between cirque side walls or head walls
get narrow because of progressive erosion and turn into
<strong>serrated</strong> or <strong>saw-toothed ridges</strong>,
sometimes referred to as <strong>arêtes</strong>, with very sharp crests
and a zig-zag outline.</p>
<h3 id="glacial-valleystroughs"><strong>Glacial
Valleys/Troughs</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Glaciated valleys</strong> are <strong>trough-like</strong>
and <strong>U-shaped</strong> with broad floors and relatively smooth,
steep sides. The valleys may contain littered debris or debris shaped as
<strong>moraines</strong> with a swampy appearance. There may be
<strong>lakes gouged out of rocky floors</strong> or formed by debris
within the valleys. There can be <strong>hanging valleys</strong> at an
elevation on one or both sides of the main glacial valley. The faces of
divides or spurs of such hanging valleys opening into main glacial
valleys are quite often truncated to give them an appearance like
<strong>triangular facets</strong>. Very deep glacial troughs filled
with sea water and making up shorelines (in high latitudes) are called
<strong>fjords/fiords</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="depositional-landforms-1"><strong>Depositional
Landforms</strong></h2>
<p>The unassorted coarse and fine debris dropped by the melting glaciers
is called <strong>glacial till</strong>. Most of the rock fragments in
till are <strong>angular to sub-angular</strong> in form.
<strong>Streams</strong> form by melting ice at the bottom, sides, or
lower ends of glaciers. Some amount of rock debris small enough to be
carried by such meltwater streams is washed down and deposited. Such
<strong>glacio-fluvial deposits</strong> are called <strong>outwash
deposits</strong>. Unlike till deposits, the outwash deposits are
roughly <strong>stratified</strong> and assorted. The rock fragments in
outwash deposits are somewhat <strong>rounded</strong> at their
edges.</p>
<h3 id="moraines"><strong>Moraines</strong></h3>
<p>They are long ridges of deposits of <strong>glacial till</strong>.
<strong>Terminal moraines</strong> are long ridges of debris deposited
at the end (toe) of the glaciers. <strong>Lateral moraines</strong> form
along the sides parallel to the glacial valleys. The lateral moraines
may join a terminal moraine forming a <strong>horse-shoe shaped
ridge</strong>. There can be many lateral moraines on either side in a
glacial valley. These moraines partly or fully owe their origin to
<strong>glacio-fluvial waters</strong> pushing up materials to the sides
of glaciers.</p>
<p>Many valley glaciers retreating rapidly leave an irregular sheet of
till over their valley floors. Such deposits varying greatly in
thickness and in surface topography are called <strong>ground
moraines</strong>. The moraine in the center of the glacial valley
flanked by lateral moraines is called <strong>medial moraine</strong>.
They are imperfectly formed compared to lateral moraines. Sometimes
medial moraines are indistinguishable from ground moraines.</p>
<h3 id="eskers"><strong>Eskers</strong></h3>
<p>When glaciers melt in summer, the water flows on the surface of the
ice, seeps down along the margins, or even moves through holes in the
ice. These waters accumulate beneath the glacier and flow like streams
in a channel beneath the ice. Such streams flow over the ground (not in
a valley cut in the ground) with ice forming its banks. Very coarse
materials like <strong>boulders and blocks</strong> along with some
minor fractions of rock debris carried into this stream settle in the
<strong>valley of ice beneath the glacier</strong>. After the ice melts,
these materials can be found as a sinuous ridge called an
<strong>esker</strong>. <strong>Outwash Plains</strong> The plains at
the foot of the <strong>glacial mountains</strong> or beyond the limits
of <strong>continental ice sheets</strong> are covered with
<strong>glacio-fluvial deposits</strong> in the form of broad flat
<strong>alluvial fans</strong> which may join to form <strong>outwash
plains</strong> of gravel, silt, sand, and clay.</p>
<h3 id="drumlins"><strong>Drumlins</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Drumlins</strong> are smooth oval-shaped ridge-like features
composed mainly of <strong>glacial till</strong> with some masses of
gravel and sand. The <strong>long axes</strong> of drumlins are parallel
to the direction of ice movement. They may measure up to 1 km in length
and 30 m or so in height. One end of the drumlins facing the glacier,
called the <strong>stoss end</strong>, is blunter and steeper than the
other end, called the tail. The drumlins form due to the dumping of rock
debris beneath heavily loaded ice through fissures in the glacier. The
stoss end gets blunted due to pushing by moving ice. Drumlins give an
indication of the <strong>direction of glacier movement</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="waves-and-currents"><strong>WAVES AND CURRENTS</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Coastal processes</strong> are the most dynamic and hence
most destructive. So, don’t you think it is important to know about the
coastal processes and forms? Some of the changes along the coasts take
place very fast. At one place, there can be <strong>erosion in one
season</strong> and <strong>deposition in another</strong>. Most of the
changes along the coasts are accomplished by <strong>waves</strong>.
When waves break, the water is thrown with great force onto the shore,
and simultaneously, there is a great churning of sediments on the sea
bottom. Constant impact of breaking waves drastically affects the
coasts. <strong>Storm waves</strong> and <strong>tsunami waves</strong>
can cause far-reaching changes in a short period of time compared to
normal breaking waves. As the <strong>wave environment changes</strong>,
the intensity of the force of breaking waves changes.</p>
<p>Other than the action of waves, the coastal landforms depend upon:
(i) the <strong>configuration of land and sea floor</strong>; (ii)
whether the coast is advancing (<strong>emerging</strong>) seaward or
retreating (<strong>submerging</strong>) landward. Assuming sea level to
be constant, two types of coasts are considered to explain the concept
of evolution of coastal landforms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>High, rocky coasts (submerged coasts)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Low, smooth, and gently sloping sedimentary coasts (emerged
coasts</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="high-rocky-coasts"><strong>HIGH ROCKY COASTS</strong></h3>
<p>Along the high rocky coasts, the rivers appear to have been
<strong>drowned with a highly irregular coastline</strong>. The
coastline appears highly indented with extensions of water into the land
where <strong>glacial valleys (fjords)</strong> are present. The
hillsides drop off sharply into the water. Shores do not show any
depositional landforms initially. <strong>Erosion features
dominate</strong>.</p>
<p>Along high rocky coasts, waves break with great force against the
land, shaping the hillsides into <strong>cliffs</strong>. With constant
pounding by waves, the cliffs recede, leaving a <strong>wave-cut
platform</strong> in front of the sea cliff. Waves gradually minimize
the irregularities along the shore.</p>
<p>The materials that fall off and are removed from the sea cliffs
gradually break into smaller fragments and roll to roundness, eventually
getting deposited in the offshore. After a considerable period of cliff
development and retreat, when the coastline turns somewhat smooth, with
the addition of some more material to this deposit in the offshore, a
<strong>wave-built terrace</strong> would develop in front of the
wave-cut terrace. As the erosion along the coast takes place, a good
supply of material becomes available to <strong>longshore
currents</strong> and waves to deposit them as <strong>beaches</strong>
along the shore and as <strong>bars</strong> (long ridges of sand and/or
shingle parallel to the coast) in the nearshore zone. Bars are submerged
features, and when bars show up above water, they are called
<strong>barrier bars</strong>. A barrier bar that gets keyed up to the
headland of a bay is called a <strong>spit</strong>. When barrier bars
and spits form at the mouth of a bay and block it, a
<strong>lagoon</strong> forms. The lagoons would gradually get filled up
by sediments from the land, giving rise to a <strong>coastal
plain</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="low-sedimentary-coasts"><strong>LOW SEDIMENTARY
COASTS</strong></h3>
<p>Along low sedimentary coasts, the rivers appear to <strong>extend
their length</strong> by building <strong>coastal plains and
deltas</strong>. The coastline appears smooth with occasional incursions
of water in the form of <strong>lagoons</strong> and <strong>tidal
creeks</strong>. The land slopes gently into the water. <strong>Marshes
and swamps</strong> may abound along the coasts. <strong>Depositional
features dominate</strong>.</p>
<p>When waves break over a gently sloping sedimentary coast, the bottom
sediments get churned and move readily, building <strong>bars</strong>,
<strong>barrier bars</strong>, <strong>spits</strong>, and
<strong>lagoons</strong>. Lagoons would eventually turn into a swamp,
which would subsequently turn into a coastal plain. The maintenance of
these depositional features depends upon the steady supply of materials.
<strong>Storm and tsunami waves</strong> cause drastic changes
irrespective of the supply of sediments. Large rivers which bring lots
of sediments build <strong>deltas</strong> along low sedimentary
coasts.</p>
<h2 id="erosional-landforms-3"><strong>EROSIONAL LANDFORMS</strong></h2>
<h3 id="cliffs-terraces-caves-and-stacks"><strong>Cliffs, Terraces,
Caves, and Stacks</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Wave-cut cliffs</strong> and <strong>terraces</strong> are
two forms usually found where <strong>erosion</strong> is the dominant
shore process. Almost all sea cliffs are steep and may range from a few
meters to 30 meters or even more. At the foot of such cliffs, there may
be a flat or gently sloping platform covered by rock debris derived from
the sea cliff behind. Such platforms occurring at elevations above the
average height of waves are called a <strong>wave-cut terrace</strong>.
The lashing of waves against the base of the cliff and the rock debris
that gets smashed against the cliff along with lashing waves create
<strong>hollows</strong> that get widened and deepened to form
<strong>sea caves</strong>. The roofs of caves collapse, and the sea
cliffs recede further inland. Retreat of the cliff may leave some
remnants of rock standing isolated as small islands just off the shore.
Such resistant masses of rock, originally parts of a cliff or hill, are
called <strong>sea stacks</strong>.</p>
<p>Like all other features, sea stacks are also temporary, and
eventually, coastal hills and cliffs will disappear because of
<strong>wave erosion</strong>, giving rise to narrow coastal plains.
With the onrush of deposits from over the land behind, these plains may
get covered up by <strong>alluvium</strong> or may get covered up by
<strong>shingle or sand</strong> to form a wide beach.</p>
<h2 id="depositional-landforms-2"><strong>DEPOSITIONAL
LANDFORMS</strong></h2>
<h3 id="beaches-and-dunes"><strong>Beaches and Dunes</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Beaches</strong> are characteristic of shorelines that are
dominated by <strong>deposition</strong>, but may occur as patches along
even the rugged shores. Most of the sediment making up the beaches comes
from land carried by the <strong>streams and rivers</strong> or from
<strong>wave erosion</strong>. Beaches are temporary features. The sandy
beach, which appears so permanent, may be reduced to a very narrow strip
of coarse pebbles in some other season. Most of the beaches are made up
of <strong>sand-sized materials</strong>. Beaches called <strong>shingle
beaches</strong> contain excessively small pebbles and even cobbles.</p>
<p>Just behind the beach, the sands lifted and winnowed from over the
beach surfaces will be deposited as <strong>sand dunes</strong>. Sand
dunes forming long ridges parallel to the coastline are very common
along <strong>low sedimentary coasts</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="bars-barriers-and-spits"><strong>Bars, Barriers, and
Spits</strong></h3>
<p>A ridge of sand and shingle formed in the sea in the offshore zone
lying approximately parallel to the coast is called an <strong>offshore
bar</strong>. An offshore bar that is exposed due to further addition of
sand is termed a <strong>barrier bar</strong>. The offshore bars and
barriers commonly form across the mouth of a river or at the entrance of
a bay. Sometimes such barrier bars get keyed up to one end of the bay
when they are called <strong>spits</strong>. Spits may also develop
attached to headlands or hills. The barriers, bars, and spits at the
mouth of the bay gradually extend, leaving only a small opening of the
bay into the sea, and the bay will eventually develop into a
<strong>lagoon</strong>. The lagoons get filled up gradually by sediment
coming from the land or from the beach itself (aided by wind) and a
broad and wide <strong>coastal plain</strong> may develop, replacing a
lagoon.</p>
<h2 id="winds"><strong>WINDS</strong></h2>
<p>Wind is one of the two dominant agents in <strong>hot
deserts</strong>. The desert floors get heated up too much and too
quickly because of being <strong>dry and barren</strong>. The heated
floors heat up the air directly above them and result in <strong>upward
movements</strong> in the hot lighter air with turbulence, and any
obstructions in its path set up eddies, whirlwinds, updrafts, and
downdrafts. Winds also move along the desert floors with great speed,
and the obstructions in their path create turbulence. Of course, there
are <strong>storm winds</strong> which are very destructive.</p>
<p>Winds cause <strong>deflation</strong>, <strong>abrasion</strong>,
and <strong>impact</strong>. <strong>Deflation</strong> includes lifting
and removal of dust and smaller particles from the surface of rocks. In
the transportation process, <strong>sand and silt</strong> act as
effective tools to abrade the land surface. The impact is simply the
sheer force of momentum, which occurs when sand is blown into or against
a rock surface. It is similar to a sand-blasting operation. The wind
action creates a number of interesting erosional and depositional
features in the deserts.</p>
<p>In fact, many features of deserts owe their formation to <strong>mass
wasting</strong> and <strong>running water</strong> as sheet floods.
Though <strong>rain is scarce</strong> in deserts, it comes down
torrentially in a short period of time. The desert rocks, devoid of
vegetation, exposed to mechanical and chemical weathering processes due
to drastic diurnal temperature changes, decay faster, and the torrential
rains help in removing the weathered materials easily. That means the
weathered debris in deserts is moved by not only wind but also by
rain/sheet wash. The wind moves fine materials, and general mass erosion
is accomplished mainly through <strong>sheet floods</strong> or
<strong>sheet wash</strong>. <strong>Stream channels</strong> in desert
areas are broad, smooth, and indefinite and flow for a brief time after
rains. ## <strong>EROSIONAL LANDFORMS</strong></p>
<h3 id="pediments-and-pediplains"><strong>Pediments and
Pediplains</strong></h3>
<p>Landscape evolution in deserts is primarily concerned with the
formation and extension of <strong>pediments</strong>. Gently inclined
rocky floors close to the mountains at their foot, with or without a
thin cover of debris, are called pediments. Such rocky floors form
through the erosion of the mountain front through a combination of
<strong>lateral erosion by streams</strong> and <strong>sheet
flooding</strong>.</p>
<p>Erosion starts along the steep margins of the landmass or the steep
sides of the tectonically controlled steep incision features over the
landmass. Once pediments are formed with a steep wash slope followed by
a cliff or free face above it, the steep wash slope and free face
retreat backward. This method of erosion is termed <strong>parallel
retreat of slopes</strong> through backwasting. So, through the parallel
retreat of slopes, the pediments extend backward at the expense of the
mountain front, and gradually, the mountain gets reduced, leaving an
<strong>inselberg</strong>, which is a remnant of the mountain. That’s
how the high relief in desert areas is reduced to low featureless plains
called <strong>pediplains</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="playas"><strong>Playas</strong></h3>
<p>Plains are by far the most prominent landforms in the deserts. In
basins with <strong>mountains and hills</strong> around, the drainage is
towards the center of the basin, and due to gradual deposition of
sediment from basin margins, a nearly level plain forms at the center of
the basin. In times of sufficient water, this plain is covered by a
shallow water body. Such shallow lakes are called
<strong>playas</strong>, where water is retained only for a short
duration due to evaporation, and quite often the playas contain good
deposition of <strong>salts</strong>. The playa plain covered by salts
is called <strong>alkali flats</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="deflation-hollows-and-caves"><strong>Deflation Hollows and
Caves</strong></h3>
<p>Weathered mantle from over the rocks or bare soil gets blown out by
persistent movement of wind currents in one direction. This process may
create shallow depressions called <strong>deflation hollows</strong>.
Deflation also creates numerous small pits or cavities over rock
surfaces. The rock faces suffer impact and abrasion from wind-borne
sand, first creating shallow depressions called
<strong>blowouts</strong>, and some of the blowouts become deeper and
wider, fit to be called <strong>caves</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="mushroom-table-and-pedestal-rocks"><strong>Mushroom, Table, and
Pedestal Rocks</strong></h3>
<p>Many rock outcrops in the deserts, easily susceptible to <strong>wind
deflation</strong> and <strong>abrasion</strong>, are worn out quickly,
leaving some remnants of resistant rocks polished beautifully in the
shape of a <strong>mushroom</strong> with a slender stalk and a broad,
rounded pear-shaped cap above. Sometimes, the top surface is broad like
a <strong>tabletop</strong>, and quite often, the remnants stand out
like <strong>pedestals</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="depositional-landforms-3"><strong>Depositional
Landforms</strong></h2>
<p>Wind is a good <strong>sorting agent</strong>. Depending upon the
velocity of wind, different sizes of grains are moved along the floors
by rolling or <strong>saltation</strong> and carried in suspension. In
this process of transportation, the materials get sorted. When the wind
slows or begins to die down, depending upon the sizes of grains and
their critical velocities, the grains will begin to settle. So, in
<strong>depositional landforms</strong> made by wind, good sorting of
grains can be found. Since wind is everywhere and wherever there is a
good source of sand and with constant wind directions, depositional
features in <strong>arid regions</strong> can develop anywhere.</p>
<h3 id="sand-dunes"><strong>Sand Dunes</strong></h3>
<p>Dry hot deserts are ideal for <strong>sand dune formation</strong>.
Obstacles to initiate dune formation are equally important. There can be
a great variety of dune forms.</p>
<p><strong>Crescent-shaped dunes</strong> called
<strong>barchans</strong> with the points or wings directed away from
the wind direction, i.e., downwind, form where the wind direction is
constant and moderate and where the original surface over which sand is
moving is almost uniform. <strong>Parabolic dunes</strong> form when
sandy surfaces are partially covered with vegetation. Parabolic dunes
are reversed barchans with the wind direction being the same.
<strong>Seif</strong> dunes are similar to barchans with a small
difference: seifs have only one wing or point. This happens when there
is a shift in wind conditions. The lone wings of seifs can grow very
long and high.</p>
<p><strong>Longitudinal dunes</strong> form when the supply of sand is
poor and wind direction is constant. They appear as long ridges of
considerable length but low in height. <strong>Transverse dunes</strong>
are aligned perpendicular to the wind direction. These dunes form when
the wind direction is constant and the source of sand is an elongated
feature at right angles to the wind direction. They may be very long and
low in height. When sand is plenty, the regular-shaped dunes often
coalesce and lose their individual characteristics. Most of the dunes in
the deserts shift, and a few of them will get stabilized, especially
near human habitations.</p>
