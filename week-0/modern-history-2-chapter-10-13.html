<h2 id="beginning-of-modern-nationalism-in-india">Beginning of Modern
Nationalism in India</h2>
<h3 id="factors-in-the-growth-of-modern-nationalism">Factors in the
Growth of Modern Nationalism</h3>
<p>The rise and growth of Indian nationalism has been traditionally
explained in terms of Indian response to the stimulus generated by the
British Raj through creation of new institutions, new opportunities,
resources, etc. In other words, Indian nationalism grew partly as a
result of colonial policies and partly as a reaction to colonial
policies. In fact, it would be more correct to see Indian nationalism as
a product of a mix of various factors: (i) Worldwide upsurge of the
concepts of nationalism and the right of self-determination initiated by
the French Revolution (ii) Indian Renaissance (iii) Offshoot of
modernisation initiated by the British in India (iv) Strong reaction to
British imperialist policies in India</p>
<h4
id="understanding-of-contradictions-in-indian-and-colonial-interests">Understanding
of Contradictions in Indian and Colonial Interests</h4>
<p>People came to realise that colonial rule was the major cause of
India’s economic backwardness and that the interests of the Indians
involved the interests of all sections and classes— peasants, artisans,
handicraftsmen, workers, intellectuals, the educated, and the
capitalists. The nationalist movement arose to take up the challenge of
these contradictions inherent in the character and policies of colonial
rule.</p>
<h4
id="political-administrative-and-economic-unification-of-the-country">Political,
Administrative, and Economic Unification of the Country</h4>
<p>The British rule in the Indian subcontinent extended from the
Himalayas in the north to the Cape Comorin in the south and from Assam
in the east to Khyber Pass in the west. While large areas of India had
been brought under a single rule in the past—under the Mauryas or later
under the Mughals— the British created a larger state than that of the
Mauryas or the great Mughals. While Indian provinces were under ‘direct’
British rule, the princely states were under ‘indirect’ British rule.
The British sword imposed political unity in India. A professional civil
service, a unified judiciary and codified civil and criminal laws
throughout the length and breadth of the country imparted a new
dimension of political unity to the hitherto cultural unity that had
existed in India for centuries. The necessities of administrative
convenience, considerations of military defence, and the urge for
economic penetration and commercial exploitation (all in British
interests) were the driving forces behind the planned development of
modern means of transport and communication such as railways, roads,
electricity, and telegraph. From the nationalists’ point of view, this
process of unification had a two-fold effect: (i) The economic fate of
the people of different regions got linked together; for instance,
failure of crops in one region affected the prices and supply in another
region.<br />
(ii) Modern means of transport and communication brought people,
especially the leaders, from different regions together. This was
important for the exchange of political ideas and for mobilisation and
organisation of public opinion on political and economic issues.</p>
<h4 id="western-thought-and-education">Western Thought and
Education</h4>
<p>The introduction of a modern system of education afforded
opportunities for assimilation of modern Western ideas. This, in turn,
gave a new direction to Indian political thinking, although the English
system of education had been conceived by the rulers in the
self-interest of efficient administration. The liberal and radical
thought of European writers like Milton, Shelley, John Stuart Mill,
Rousseau, Paine, Spencer and Voltaire helped many Indians imbibe modern
rational, secular, democratic, and nationalist ideas. The English
language helped nationalist leaders from different linguistic regions to
communicate with each other. Those among the educated who took up
liberal professions (lawyers, doctors, etc.) often visited England for
higher education. There they saw the working of modern political
institutions in a free country and compared that system with the Indian
situation where even basic rights were denied to the citizens. This
ever-expanding English educated class formed the middle-class
intelligentsia who constituted the nucleus for the newly arising
political unrest. It was this section which provided leadership to the
Indian political associations.</p>
<h4 id="role-of-press-and-literature">Role of Press and Literature</h4>
<p>The second half of the 19th century saw an unprecedented growth of
Indian-owned English and vernacular newspapers, despite numerous
restrictions imposed on the press by the colonial rulers from time to
time. In 1877, there were about 169 newspapers published in vernacular
languages and their circulation reached the neighbourhood of 1,00,000.
The press while criticising official policies, on the one hand, urged
the people to unite, on the other. It also helped spread modern ideas of
self-government, democracy, civil rights, and industrialisation. The
newspapers, journals, pamphlets, and nationalist literature helped in
the exchange of political ideas among nationalist leaders from different
regions.</p>
<h4 id="rediscovery-of-indias-past">Rediscovery of India’s Past</h4>
<p>The historical researches by European scholars, such as Max Mueller,
Monier Williams, Roth and Sassoon, and by Indian scholars such as R.G.
Bhandarkar, R.L. Mitra, and later Swami Vivekananda, created an entirely
new picture of India’s past. This picture was characterised by
well-developed political, economic, and social institutions, a
flourishing trade with the outside world, a rich heritage in arts and
culture and numerous cities. The theory put forward by European
scholars, that the Indo-Aryans belonged to the same ethnic group from
which other nations of Europe had evolved, gave a psychological boost to
the educated Indians. The self-respect and confidence so gained helped
the nationalists to demolish colonial myths that India had a long
history of servility to foreign rulers.</p>
<h4
id="progressive-character-of-socio-religious-reform-movements">Progressive
Character of Socio-religious Reform Movements</h4>
<p>These reform movements sought to remove social evils which divided
the Indian society; this had the effect of bringing different sections
together and proved to be an important factor in the growth of Indian
nationalism.</p>
<h4 id="rise-of-middle-class-intelligentsia">Rise of Middle-Class
Intelligentsia</h4>
<p>British administrative and economic innovations gave rise to a new
urban middle class in towns. According to Percival Spear, “The new
middle class was a well-integrated all-India class with varied
background but a common foreground of knowledge, ideas and values…. It
was a minority of Indian society, but a dynamic minority…. It had a
sense of unity of purpose and of hope.” This class, prominent because of
its education, new position, and its close ties with the ruling class,
came to the forefront. The leadership to the Indian National Congress in
all its stages of growth was provided by this class.</p>
<h4 id="impact-of-contemporary-movements-in-the-world">Impact of
Contemporary Movements in the World</h4>
<p>Rise of a number of nations on the ruins of the Spanish and
Portuguese empires in South America, and the national liberation
movements of Greece and Italy in general and of Ireland in particular
deeply influenced the nationalist ranks.</p>
<h4 id="reactionary-policies-and-racial-arrogance-of-rulers">Reactionary
Policies and Racial Arrogance of Rulers</h4>
<p>Racial myths of white superiority were sought to be perpetuated by
the British through a deliberate policy of discrimination and
segregation. Indians felt deeply hurt by this. Lytton’s reactionary
policies such as reduction of maximum age limit for the I.C.S.
examination from 21 years to 19 years (1876), the grand Delhi Durbar of
1877 when the country was in the severe grip of famine, the Vernacular
Press Act (1878), and the Arms Act (1878) provoked a storm of opposition
in the country. Then came the Ilbert Bill controversy. Ripon’s
Government had sought to abolish “judicial disqualification based on
race distinctions” and to give the Indian members of the covenanted
civil service the same powers and rights as those enjoyed by their
European colleagues. Ripon had to modify the bill, thus almost defeating
the original purpose, because of the stiff opposition from the European
community. It became clear to the nationalists that justice and fair
play could not be expected where interests of the European community
were involved. However, the organised agitation by the Europeans to
revoke the Ilbert Bill also taught the nationalists how to agitate for
certain rights and demands.</p>
<h3
id="political-associations-before-the-indian-national-congress">Political
Associations Before the Indian National Congress</h3>
<p>The Indian National Congress was not the first political organisation
in India. However, most of the political associations in the early half
of the 19th century were dominated by wealthy and aristocratic elements.
They were local or regional in character. Through long petitions to the
British Parliament most of them demanded— ● administrative reforms; ●
association of Indians with the administration; and ● spread of
education. The political associations of the second half of the 19th
century came to be increasingly dominated by the educated middle
class—the lawyers, journalists, doctors, teachers, etc.,—and they had a
wider perspective and a larger agenda.</p>
<h4 id="political-associations-in-bengal">Political Associations in
Bengal</h4>
<p>T he Bangabhasha Prakasika Sabha was formed in 1836 by associates of
Raja Rammohan Roy. The Zamindari Association, more popularly known as
the ‘Landholders’ Society’, was founded to safeguard the interests of
the landlords. Although limited in its objectives, the Landholders’
Society marked the beginning of an organised political activity and use
of methods of constitutional agitation for the redressal of grievances.
The Bengal British India Society was founded in 1843 with the object of
“the collection and dissemination of information relating to the actual
condition of the people of British India… and to employ such other means
of peaceful and lawful character as may appear calculated to secure the
welfare, extend the just rights and advance the interests of all classes
of our fellow subjects”. In 1851, both the Landholders’ Society and the
Bengal British India Society merged into the British Indian Association.
It sent a petition to the British Parliament demanding inclusion of some
of its suggestions in the renewed Charter of the Company, such as: (i)
establishment of a separate legislature of a popular character; (ii)
separation of executive from judicial functions; (iii) reduction in
salaries of higher officers; and (iv) abolition of salt duty, abkari,
and stamp duties. These were partially accepted when the Charter Act of
1853 provided for the addition of six members to the governor general’s
council for legislative purposes. The East India Association was
organised by Dadabhai Naoroji in 1866 in London to discuss the Indian
question and influence public men in England to promote Indian welfare.
Later, branches of the association were started in prominent Indian
cities. The Indian League was started in 1875 by Sisir Kumar Ghosh with
the object of “stimulating the sense of nationalism amongst the people”
and of encouraging political education. The Indian Association of
Calcutta (also known as the Indian National Association) superseded the
Indian League and was founded in 1876 by younger nationalists of Bengal
led by Surendranath Banerjea and Ananda Mohan Bose, who were getting
discontented with the conservative and pro-landlord policies of the
British Indian Association. The Indian Association was the most
important of pre- Congress associations and aimed to “promote by every
legitimate means the political, intellectual and material advancement of
the people.” It set out to: (i) create a strong public opinion on
political questions; and (ii) unify Indian people in a common political
programme. It protested against the reduction of age limit in 1877 for
candidates of the Indian Civil Service examination. The association
demanded simultaneous holding of civil service examination in England
and India and Indianisation of higher administrative posts. It led a
campaign against the repressive arms act and the vernacular press act.
Branches of the association were opened in other towns and cities of
Bengal and even outside Bengal . The membership fee was kept low in
order to attract the poorer sections to the association. The association
sponsored an all-India conference which first took place in Calcutta
from December 28 to 30, 1883. More than hundred delegates from different
parts of the country attended. So, in a way, the association was a
forerunner of the Indian National Congress as an all-India nationalist
organisation. It later merged with the Indian National Congress in
1886.</p>
<h4 id="political-associations-in-bombay">Political Associations in
Bombay</h4>
<p>The Poona Sarvajanik Sabha was founded in 1867 by Mahadev Govind
Ranade and others, with the object of serving as a bridge between the
government and the people. The Bombay Presidency Association was started
by Badruddin Tyabji, Pherozeshah Mehta, and K.T. Telang in 1885.</p>
<h4 id="political-associations-in-madras">Political Associations in
Madras</h4>
<p>The Madras Mahajan Sabha was founded in 1884 by M. Viraraghavachari
(also, Veeraraghavachariar), B. Subramania Aiyer, and P. Ananda-
charlu.</p>
<h3 id="pre-congress-campaigns">Pre-Congress Campaigns</h3>
<p>The associations organised various campaigns before the Indian
National Congress appeared on the scene. These campaigns were: (i) for
imposition of import duty on cotton (1875) (ii) for Indianisation of
government service (1878–79) (iii) against Lytton’s Afghan adventure
(iv) against Arms Act (1878) (v) against Vernacular Press Act (1878)
(vi) for right to join volunteer corps (vii) against plantation labour
and against Inland Emigration Act (viii) in support of Ilbert Bill (ix)
for an All-India Fund for Political Agitation (x) campaign in Britain to
vote for pro-India party (xi) against reduction in maximum age for
appearing in Indian Civil Service; the Indian Association took up this
question and organised an all-India agitation against it, popularly
known as the Indian Civil Service agitation. Summary ● Factors in Growth

<h2
id="indian-national-congress-foundation-and-the-moderate-phase">Indian
National Congress: Foundation and the Moderate Phase</h2>
<h3 id="foundation-of-the-indian-national-congress">Foundation of the
Indian National Congress</h3>
<p>In the later 1870s and early 1880s, a solid ground had been prepared
for the establishment of an all-India organisation. The final shape to
this idea was given by a retired English civil servant, A.O. Hume, who
mobilised leading intellectuals of the time and, with their cooperation,
organised the first session of the Indian National Congress at Gokuldas
Tejpal Sanskrit College in Bombay in December 1885. As a prelude to
this, two sessions of the Indian National Conference had been held in
1883 and 1885, which had representatives drawn from all major towns of
India. Surendranath Banerjea and Ananda Mohan Bose were the main
architects of the Indian National Conference. The first session of the
Indian National Congress was attended by 72 delegates and presided over
by Womesh Chandra (or Chunder) Bonnerjee. Hereafter, the Congress met
every year in December, in a different part of the country each time.
Some of the great presidents of the Congress during this early phase
were Dadabhai Naoroji (thrice p resident), Badruddin Tyabji, Pherozeshah
Mehta, P. Anandacharlu, Surendranath Banerjea, Romesh Chandra Dutt,
Ananda Mohan Bose, and Gopal Krishna Gokhale. Other prominent leaders
included Mahadev Govind Ranade, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Sisir Kumar Ghosh,
Motilal Ghosh, Madan Mohan Malaviya, G. Subramania Aiyar, C.
Vijayaraghavachariar, Dinshaw E. Wacha. In 1890, Kadambini Ganguly, the
first woman graduate of Calcutta University, addressed the Congress
session, which symbolised the commitment of the freedom struggle to give
the women of India their due status in national life. Apart from the
Indian National Congress, nationalist activity was carried out through
provincial conferences and associations, newspapers, and literature.</p>
<h4 id="was-it-a-safety-valve">Was It a Safety Valve</h4>
<p>? There is a theory that Hume formed the Congress with the idea that
it would prove to be a ‘safety valve’ for releasing the growing
discontent of the Indians. To this end, he convinced Lord Dufferin not
to obstruct the formation of the Congress. The extremist leaders like
Lala Lajpat Rai believed in the ‘safety valve’ theory. Even the Marxist
historian’s ‘conspiracy theory’ was an offspring of the ‘safety valve’
notion. For example, R.P. Dutt opined that the Indian National Congress
was born out of a conspiracy to abort a popular uprising in India and
the bourgeois leaders were a party to it. Modern Indian historians,
however, dispute the idea of ‘safety valve’. In their opinion, the
Indian National Congress represented the urge of the politically
conscious Indians to set up a national body to express the political and
economic demands of the Indians. If the Indians had convened such a body
on their own, there would have been unsurmountable opposition from the
officials; such an organisation would not have been allowed to form. In
the circumstances, as Bipan Chandra observes, the early Congress leaders
used Hume as a ‘lightning conductor’, i.e., as a catalyst to bring
together the nationalistic forces even if under the guise of a ‘safety
valve’.</p>
<h4 id="aims-and-objectives-of-the-congress">Aims and Objectives of the
Congress</h4>
<p>The main aims of the Indian National Congress in the initial stage
were to: (i) found a democratic, nationalist movement; (ii) politicise
and politically educate people; (iii) establish the headquarters for a
movement; (iv) promote friendly relations among nationalist political
workers from different parts of the country; (v) develop and propagate
an anti-colonial nationalist ideology; (vi) formulate and present
popular demands before the government with a view to unifying the people
over a common economic and political programme; (vii) develop and
consolidate a feeling of national unity among people irrespective of
religion, caste, or province. (viii) carefully promote and nurture
Indian nationhood.</p>
<h3 id="era-of-moderates-18851905">Era of Moderates (1885–1905)</h3>
<h4 id="important-leaders">Important Leaders</h4>
<p>The national leaders like Dadabhai Naoroji, Pherozeshah Mehta, D.E.
Wacha, W.C. Bonnerjea, S.N. Banerjea who dominated the Congress policies
during the early period (1885–1905) were staunch believers in
‘liberalism’ and ‘moderate’ politics and came to be labelled as
Moderates to distinguish them from the neo-nationalists of the early
twentieth century who were referred to as the Extremists.</p>
<h4 id="moderate-approach">Moderate Approach</h4>
<p>The moderate political activity involved constitutional agitation
within the confines of law and showed a slow but orderly political
progress. The Moderates believed that the British basically wanted to be
just to the Indians but were not aware of the real conditions.
Therefore, if public opinion could be created in the country and public
demands be presented to the government through resolutions, petitions,
meetings, etc., the authorities would concede these demands gradually. T
o achieve these ends, they worked on a two-pronged methodology—one,
create a strong public opinion to arouse consciousness and national
spirit and then educate and unite people on common political questions;
and two, persuade the British Government and British public opinion to
introduce reforms in India on the lines laid out by the nationalists.
They used the method of ‘prayer and petition’ and if that failed, they
resorted to constitutional agitation. A British committee of the Indian
National Congress was established in London in 1889 which had India as
its organ. Dadabhai Naoroji spent a substantial portion of his life and
income campaigning for India’s case abroad. In 1890, it was decided to
hold a session of the Indian National Congress in London in 1892, but
owing to the British elections of 1891 the proposal was postponed and
never revived later. The Moderate leaders believed that political
connections with Britain were in India’s interest at that stage of
history and that the time was not ripe for a direct challenge to the
British rule. Therefore, it was considered to be appropriate to try and
transform the colonial rule to be as close to a national rule as
possible.</p>
<h3 id="contributions-of-moderate-nationalists">Contributions of
Moderate Nationalists</h3>
<h4 id="economic-critique-of-british-imperialism">Economic Critique of
British Imperialism</h4>
<p>The early nationalists, led by Dadabhai Naoroji, R.C. Dutt, Dinshaw
Wacha and others, carefully analysed the political economy of British
rule in India, and put forward the “drain theory” to explain British
exploitation of India. They opposed the transformation of a basically
self-sufficient Indian economy into a colonial economy (i.e., a supplier
of raw materials and food stuff, an importer of finished goods and a
field of investment for British capital). Thus, the Moderates were able
to create an all-India public opinion that British rule in India was the
major cause of India’s poverty and economic backwardness. To mitigate
the deprivation characterising Indian life, t he early nationalists
demanded severance of India’s economic subservience to Britain and
development of an independent economy through involvement of Indian
capital and enterprise. The early nationalists demanded reduction in
land revenue, abolition of salt tax, improvement in working conditions
of plantation labour, reduction in military expenditure, and
encouragement to modern industry through tariff protection and direct
government aid. (Also refer to chapter on Economic Impact of British
Rule in India.)</p>
<h4
id="constitutional-reforms-and-propaganda-in-legislature">Constitutional
Reforms and Propaganda in Legislature</h4>
<p>Legislative councils in India had no real official power till 1920.
Yet, work done in them by the nationalists helped the growth of the
national movement. The Imperial Legislative Council constituted by the
Indian Councils Act (1861) was an impotent body designed to disguise
official measures as having been passed by a representative body. Indian
members were few in number—in the 30 years from 1862 to 1892 only 45
Indians were nominated to it, most of them being wealthy, landed, and
with loyalist interests. Only a handful of political figures and
independent intellectuals such as Syed Ahmed Khan, Kristodas Pal, V.N.
Mandlik, K.L. Nulkar, and Rashbehari Ghosh (also written as Rash Behari
Ghose) were among those nominated. From 1885 to 1892, the nationalist
demands for constitutional reforms were centred around: (i) expansion of
councils—i.e., greater participation of Indians in councils; and (ii)
reform of councils—i.e., more powers to councils, especially greater
control over finances. The early nationalists worked with the long-term
objective of a democratic self-government. Their demands for
constitutional reforms were meant to have been conceded in 1892 in the
form of the Indian Councils Act. These reforms were severely criticised
at Congress sessions, where the nationalists made no secret of their
dissatisfaction with them. Now, they demanded: (i) a majority of elected
Indians; and (ii) control over the budget, i.e., the power to vote upon
and amend the budget. They gave the slogan—“No taxation without
representation”. Gradually, the scope of constitutional demands was
widened. Dadabhai Naoroji (1904), Gopal Krishna Gokhale (1905), and
Lokmanya Tilak (1906) demanded self-government on the lines of the
self-governing colonies of Canada and Australia. Also, leaders like
Pherozeshah Mehta and Gokhale put government policies and proposals to
severe criticism. The British had intended to use the councils to
incorporate the more vocal among Indian leaders, so as to allow them to
let off their “political steam”, while the impotent councils could
afford to remain deaf to their criticism. But the nationalists were able
to transform these councils into forums for ventilating popular
grievances, for exposing the defects of an indifferent bureaucracy, for
criticising government policies/proposals, raising basic economic
issues, especially regarding public finance. Indian Councils Act, 1892
Main Provisions ● Number of additional members in Imperial Legislative
Councils and the Provincial Legislative Councils was raised. In Imperial
Legislative Council, now the governor general could have 10 to 16
non-officials (instead of six to ten previously). ● The non-official
members of the Indian legislative council were to be nominated by the
Bengal Chamber of Commerce and provincial legislative councils. The
members could be recommended by universities, municipalities, zamindars,
and chambers of commerce. So, the principle of representation was
introduced. ● Budget could be discussed. ● Questions could be asked.
Limitations ● The officials retained their majority in the council, thus
making ineffective the non-official voice. ● The ‘reformed’ Imperial
Legislative Council met, during its tenure till 1909, on an average for
only 13 days in a year, and the number of unofficial Indian members
present was only five out of twenty-four. ● The budget could not be
voted upon, nor could any amendments be made to it. ● Supplementaries
could not be asked, nor could answers to any question be discussed. The
nationalists were, thus, able to enhance their political stature and
build a national movement while undermining the political and moral
influence of imperialist rule. This helped in generating
anti-imperialist sentiments among the public. But, at the same time, the
nationalists failed to widen the democratic base of the movement by not
including the masses, especially women, and not demanding the right to
vote for all.</p>
<h4 id="campaign-for-general-administrative">Campaign for General
Administrative</h4>
<p>Reforms The Moderates campaigned on the following grounds: (i)
Indianisation of government service: on the economic grounds that
British civil servants got very high emoluments while inclusion of
Indians would be more economical; on political grounds that, since
salaries of British bureaucrats were remitted back home and pensions
paid in England (all drawn from Indian revenue), this amounted to
economic drain of national resources; and on moral grounds that Indians
were being discriminated against by being kept away from positions of
trust and responsibility. (ii) Call for separation of judicial from
executive functions. (iii) Criticism of an oppressive and tyrannical
bureaucracy and an expensive and time-consuming judicial system. (iv)
Criticism of an aggressive foreign policy which resulted in annexation
of Burma, attack on Afghanistan, and suppression of tribals in the
North-West—all costing heavily for the Indian treasury. (v) Call for
increase in expenditure on welfare (i.e., health, sanitation),
education—especially elementary and technical—irrigation works and
improvement of agriculture, agricultural banks for cultivators, etc.
(vi) Demand for better treatment for Indian labour abroad in other
British colonies, where they faced oppression and racial
discrimination.</p>
<h4 id="protection-of-civil-rights">Protection of Civil Rights</h4>
<p>Civil rights included the right to speech, thought, association, and
a free press. Through an incessant campaign, the nationalistswere able
to spread modern democratic ideas, and soon the defence of civil rights
became an integral part of the freedom struggle. It was due to the
increased consciousness that there was a great public outrage at the
arrest of Tilak and several other leaders and journalists in 1897 and at
the arrest and deportation of the Natu brothers without a trial. (Also
refer to chapter on Development of Press in India.)</p>
<h3 id="an-evaluation-of-the-early-nationalists">An Evaluation of the
Early Nationalists</h3>
<p>The early nationalists did a great deal to awaken the national
sentiment, even though they could not draw the masses to them. (i) They
represented the most progressive forces of the time. (ii) They were able
to create a wide national awakening of all Indians having common
interests and the need to rally around a common programme against a
common enemy, and above all, the feeling of belonging to one nation.
(iii) They trained people in political work and popularised modern
ideas. (iv) They exposed the basically exploitative character of
colonial rule, thus undermining its moral foundations. (v) Their
political work was based on hard realities, and not on shallow
sentiments, religion, etc. (vi) They were able to establish the basic
political truth that India should be ruled in the interest of Indians.
(vii) They created a solid base for a more vigorous, militant,
mass-based national movement in the years that followed. (viii) However,
they failed to widen their democratic base and the scope of their
demands. Views You don’t realise our place in the history of our
country. These memorials are nominally addressed to the Government. In
reality they are addressed to the people, so that they may learn how to
think in these matters. This work must be done for many years, without
expecting any other results, because politics of this kind is altogether
new in this land. —Justice Mahadev Govind Ranade to Gokhale (1891)</p>
<h4 id="role-of-masses">Role of Masses</h4>
<p>The moderate phase of the national movement had a narrow social base
and the masses played a passive role. This was because the early
nationalists lacked political faith in the masses; they felt that there
were numerous divisions and subdivisions in the Indian society, and the
masses were generally ignorant and had conservative ideas and thoughts.
The Moderates felt that these heterogeneous elements had first to be
welded into a nation before they entered the political sphere. But they
failed to realise that it was only during a freedom struggle and with
political participation that these diverse elements could come together.
Because of the lack of mass participation, the Moderates could not take
militant political positions against the authorities. The later
nationalists differed from the Moderates precisely on this point. Still,
the early nationalists represented the emerging Indian nation against
colonial interests. Views We cannot blame them for the attitude they
adopted as pioneers of Indian political reform any more than we can
blame the brick and mortar that is buried six feet deep in the
foundation and plinth of a modern edifice. They have made possible the
superstructure, storey by storey, by colonial self-government, home rule
within the empire, swaraj and on the top of all, complete independence.
—Pattabhi Sitaramayya The period from 1858 to 1905 was the seed time of
Indian nationalism; and the early nationalists sowed the seeds well and
deep. —Bipan Chandra It was at best an opportunist movement. It opened
opportunities for treacheries and hypocrisies. It enabled some people to
trade in the name of patriotism. —Lala Lajpat Rai</p>
<h4 id="attitude-of-the-government">Attitude of the Government</h4>
<p>The British Indian Government was hostile to the Congress from the
beginning despite the latter’s moderate methods and emphasis on loyalty
to the British Crown. The official attitude stiffened further after 1887

of the colonial rule. Now, the government resorted to open condemnation
of the Congress, calling the nationalists “seditious brahmins”,
“disloyal babus”, etc. Dufferin called the Congress “a factory of
sedition”. Later, the government adopted a ‘divide and rule’ policy
towards the Congress. The officials encouraged reactionary elements like
Sir Syed Ahmed Khan and Raja Shiv Prasad Singh of Benaras to organise
the United Indian Patriotic Association to counter Congress propaganda.
The government also tried to divide the nationalists on the basis of
religion, and, through a policy of ‘carrot and stick’, pitted the
Moderates against the Extremists. But the government failed to check the
rising tide of nationalism.</p>

Nationalism (1905–1909)</h2>
<h4 id="growth-of-militant-nationalism">Growth of Militant
Nationalism</h4>
<p>A radical trend of a militant nationalist approach to political
activity started emerging in the 1890s, and it took a concrete shape by
1905. As an adjunct to this trend, a revolutionary wing also took
shape.</p>
<h4 id="why-militant-nationalism-grew">Why Militant Nationalism
Grew</h4>
<p>Many factors contributed to the rise of militant nationalism.</p>
<h4 id="recognition-of-the-true-nature-of-british-rule">Recognition of
the True Nature of British Rule</h4>
<p>Having seen that the British government was not conceding any of
their important demands, the more militant among 272 UNIT 6 National
Movement (1905–1918) Chapters 12 to 14 t hose politically conscious got
disillusioned and started looking for a more effective mode of political
action. Also, the feeling that only an Indian government could lead
India on to a path of progress started attracting more and more people.
The economic miseries of the 1890s further exposed the exploitative
character of colonial rule. Severe famines killed 90 lakh persons
between 1896 and 1900. Bubonic plague affected large areas of the
Deccan. There were largescale riots in the Deccan. The nationalists were
wide awake to the fact that instead of giving more rights to the
Indians, the government was taking away even the existing ones. 1892—
The Indian Councils Act was criticised by nationalists as it failed to
satisfy them. 1897— The Natu brothers were deported without trial and
Tilak and others, imprisoned on charges of sedition. 1898— Repressive
laws under IPC Section 124 A were further amplified with new provisions
under IPC Section 156 A. 1899— The number of Indian members in Calcutta
Corporation were reduced. 1904— Official Secrets Act curbed freedom of
press. 1904— The Indian Universities Act ensured greater government
control over universities, which it described as factories producing
political revolutionaries. Also, British rule was no longer progressive
socially and culturally. It was suppressing the spread of education,
especially mass and technical education.</p>
<h4 id="growth-of-confidence-and-self-respect">Growth of Confidence and
Self-Respect</h4>
<p>There was a growing faith in self-effort. Tilak, Aurobindo, and Bipin
Chandra Pal repeatedly urged the nationalists to rely on the character
and capacities of the Indian people. A feeling started gaining currency
that the masses had to be involved in the battle against colonial
government as they were capable of making the immense sacrifices needed
to win freedom.</p>
<h4 id="growth-of-education">Growth of Education</h4>
<p>While, on the one hand, the spread of education led to an increased
awareness among the masses, on the other hand, t he rise in unemployment
and underemployment among the educated drew attention to poverty and the
underdeveloped state of the country’s economy under colonial rule. This
added to the already simmering discontent among the more radical
nationalists.</p>
<h4 id="international-influences">International Influences</h4>
<p>Remarkable progress made by Japan after 1868 and its emergence as an
industrial power opened the eyes of Indians to the fact that economic
progress was possible even in an Asian country without any external
help. The defeat of the Italian army by Ethiopians (1896), the Boer wars
(1899– 1902) where the British faced reverses, and Japan’s victory over
Russia (1905) demolished myths of European invincibility. Also, the
nationalists were inspired by the nationalist movements worldwide—in
Ireland, Russia, Egypt, Turkey, Persia, and China. The Indians realised
that a united people willing to make sacrifices could take on the
mightiest of empires.</p>
<h4 id="reaction-to-increasing-westernisation">Reaction to Increasing
Westernisation</h4>
<p>The new leadership felt the stranglehold of excessive westernisation
and sensed colonial designs to submerge the Indian national identity in
the British Empire. The intellectual and moral inspiration of the new
leadership was Indian. Intellectuals like Swami Vivekananda, Bankim
Chandra Chatterjee, and Swami Dayananda Saraswati inspired many young
nationalists with their forceful and articulate arguments, painting
India’s past in brighter colours than the British ideologues had. These
thinkers exploded the myth of western superiority by referring to the
richness of the Indian civilisation in the past. Dayananda’s political
message was ‘India for the Indians’.</p>
<h4 id="dissatisfaction-with-achievements-of-moderates">Dissatisfaction
with Achievements of Moderates</h4>
<p>The younger elements within the Congress were dissatisfied with the
achievements of the Moderates during the first 15– 20 years. They were
strongly critical of the methods of peaceful and constitutional
agitation, popularly known as the “Three ‘P’s”—prayer, petition and
protest—and described these methods as ‘political mendicancy’.</p>
<h4 id="reactionary-policies-of-curzon">Reactionary Policies of
Curzon</h4>
<p>A sharp reaction was created in the Indian mind by Curzon’s
seven-year rule in India which was full of missions, commissions, and
omissions. He refused to recognise India as a nation and insulted Indian
nationalists and the intelligentsia by describing their activities as
“letting off of gas”. He spoke derogatorily of Indian character in
general. Administrative measures adopted during his rule—the Official
Secrets Act, the Indian Universities Act, the Calcutta Corporation Act,
and, above all, the partition of Bengal —left no doubt in Indian minds
about the basically reactionary nature of British rule in India.</p>
<h4 id="existence-of-a-militant-school-of-thought">Existence of a
Militant School of Thought</h4>
<p>By the dawn of the 20th century, a band of nationalist thinkers had
emerged who advocated a more militant approach to political work. These
included Raj Narain Bose, Ashwini Kumar Dutta, Aurobindo Ghosh, and
Bipin Chandra Pal in Bengal ; Vishnu Shastri Chiplunkar and Bal
Gangadhar Tilak in Maharashtra</p>
<p>; and Lala Lajpat Rai in Punjab. Tilak emerged as the most
outstanding representative of this school of thought. The basic tenets
of this school of thought were: ● hatred for foreign rule; since no hope
could be derived from it, Indians should work out their own salvation; ●
swaraj to be the goal of national movement; ● direct political action
required;</p>
<p>● belief in the capacity of the masses to challenge the authority; ●
personal sacrifices required and a true nationalist to be always ready
for it.</p>
<h4 id="emergence-of-a-trained-leadership">Emergence of a Trained
Leadership</h4>
<p>The new leadership could provide a proper channelisation of the
immense potential for political struggle which the masses possessed and,
as the militant nationalists thought, were ready to give expression to.
This energy of the masses got a release during the movement against the
partition of Bengal , which acquired the form of the swadeshi
agitation.</p>

<h3 id="the-swadeshi-and-boycott-movement">The Swadeshi and Boycott
Movement</h3>
<p>The Swadeshi Movement had its genesis in the anti-partition movement
which was started to oppose the British decision to partition Bengal
.</p>
<h4 id="partition-of-bengal-to-divide-people">Partition of Bengal to
Divide People</h4>
<p>The British government’s decision to partition Bengal had been made
public in December 1903. The idea was to have two provinces: Bengal
comprising Western Bengal as well as the provinces of Bihar and Orissa,
and Eastern Bengal , and Assam. Bengal retained Calcutta as its capital,
while Dacca became the capital of Eastern Bengal . The official reason
given for the decision was that Bengal , with a population of 78 million
(about a quarter of the population of British India), had become too big
to be administered. It was also stated that partition would help in the
development of Assam if it came under the direct jurisdiction of the
government. This was true to some extent, but the real motive behind the
partition plan was seen to be the British desire to weaken Bengal , the
nerve centre of Indian nationalism. This it sought to achieve by putting
the Bengal is under two administrations by dividing them: (i) on the
basis of language, thus reducing the Bengal is to a minority in Bengal
itself (as in the new proposal Bengal proper was to have 17
million<br />
Bengal is and 37 million Hindi and Oriya speakers); and (ii) on the
basis of religion, as the western half was to be a Hindu majority area
(42 million out of a total 54 million) and the eastern half was to be a
Muslim majority area (18 million out of a total of 31 million). Trying
to woo the Muslims, Curzon, the viceroy at that time, argued that Dacca
could become the capital of the new Muslim majority province, which
would provide them with a unity not experienced by them since the days
of old Muslim viceroys and kings. Thus, it was clear that the government
was up to its old policy of propping up Muslim communalists to counter
the Congress and the national movement.</p>
<h4 id="anti-partition-campaign-under-moderates-190305">Anti-Partition
Campaign Under Moderates (1903–05)</h4>
<p>In the period 1903–05, the leadership was provided by men like
Surendranath Banerjea, K.K. Mitra, and Prithwishchandra Ray. The methods
adopted were petitions to the government, public meetings, memoranda,
and propaganda through pamphlets and newspapers such as Hitabadi,
Sanjibani, and Bengal ee. Their objective was to exert sufficient
pressure on the government through an educated public opinion in India
and England to prevent the unjust partition of Bengal from being
implemented. Ignoring a loud public opinion against the partition
proposal, the government announced the partition of Bengal in July 1905.
Within days, protest meetings were held in small towns all over Bengal .
It was in these meetings that the pledge to boycott foreign goods was
first taken. On August 7, 1905, with the passage of the Boycott
Resolution in a massive meeting held in the Calcutta Townhall, the f
ormal proclamation of Swadeshi Movement was made. After this, the
leaders dispersed to other parts of Bengal to propagate the message of
boycott of Manchester cloth and Liverpool salt. October 16, 1905, the
day the partition formally came into force, was observed as a day of
mourning throughout Bengal . People fasted, bathed in the Ganga, and
walked barefoot in processions singing Bande Mataram (which almost
spontaneously became the theme song of the movement). ‘Amar Sonar
Bangla’, the national anthem of present-day Bangladesh, was composed by
Rabindranath Tagore and sung by huge crowds marching in the streets.
Rabindranath Tagore and Ramendrasundar Trivedi, secretary of the Bangiya
Sahitya Parishad at the time, appealed to the people to observe
Rakshabandhan day on the date the partition came into effect, i.e., on
October 6, 1905. People tied rakhis on each other’s hands as a symbol of
unity of the two halves of Bengal . Later in the day, Surendranath
Banerjea and Ananda Mohan Bose addressed huge gatherings (perhaps the
largest till then under the nationalist banner). Within a few hours of
the meeting, Rs 50,000 was raised for the movement. Soon, the movement
spread to other parts of the country—in Poona and Bombay under Tilak; in
Punjab under Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh; in Delhi under Syed Haider
Raza; and in Madras under Chidambaram Pillai.</p>
<h4 id="view">View</h4>
<p>Bengal united is a power. Bengal divided will pull in several
different ways…….. One of our main objects is to split up and thereby to
weaken a solid body of opponents to our rule. —Risley (home secretary to
the Government of India, 1904)</p>
<h4 id="the-congress-position">The Congress Position</h4>
<p>The Indian National Congress meeting in 1905, under the presidentship
of Gokhale, resolved to: (i) condemn the partition of Bengal and the
reactionary policies of Curzon , and (ii) support the anti-partition and
Swadeshi Movement of Bengal . The militant nationalists led by Tilak,
Lajpat Rai, Bipin Chandra Pal, and Aurobindo Ghosh wanted the movement
to be taken outside Bengal to other parts of the country and go beyond a
boycott of foreign goods to become a fullfledged political mass struggle
with the goal of attaining swaraj. But the Moderates, dominating the
Congress at that time, were not willing to go that far. However, a big
step forward was taken at the Congress session held at Calcutta ( 1906)
under the presidentship of Dadabhai Naoroji, where it was declared that
the goal of the Indian National Congress was “self-government or swaraj
like the United Kingdom or the colonies” of Australia or Canada. The
Moderate-Extremist dispute over the pace of the movement and techniques
of struggle reached a deadlock at the Surat session of the Indian
National Congress (1907) where the party split with serious consequences
for the Swadeshi Movement.</p>
<h3 id="the-movement-under-extremist-leadership">The Movement under
Extremist Leadership</h3>
<p>After 1905, the Extremists acquired a dominant influence over the
Swadeshi Movement in Bengal . There were three reasons for this: (i) The
Moderate-led movement had failed to yield results. (ii) The divisive
tactics of the governments of both the Bengal s had embittered the
nationalists. (iii) The government had resorted to suppressive measures,
which included atrocities on students—many of whom were given corporal
punishment; ban on public singing of Vande Mataram; restriction on
public meetings; prosecution and long imprisonment of swadeshi workers;
clashes between the police and the people in many towns; arrests and
deportation of leaders; and suppression of freedom of the press.</p>
<h4 id="the-extremist-programme">The Extremist Programme</h4>
<p>Emboldened by Dadabhai Naoroji’s declaration at the Calcutta session
(1906) that self-government or swaraj was to be the goal of the
Congress, the Extremists gave a call for passive resistance in addition
to swadeshi and boycott which would include a boycott of government
schools and colleges, government service, courts, legislative councils,
municipalities, government titles, etc. The purpose, as Aurobindo put
it, was to “make the administration under present conditions impossible
by an organised refusal to do anything which will help either the
British commerce in the e xploitation of the country or British
officialdom in the administration of it”. The militant nationalists
tried to transform the antipartition and Swadeshi Movement into a mass
struggle and gave the slogan of India’s independence from foreign rule.
“Political freedom is the lifebreath of a nation,” declared Aurobindo.
Thus, the Extremists gave the idea of India’s independence the central
place in India’s politics. The goal of independence was to be achieved
through self-sacrifice.</p>
<h4 id="new-forms-of-struggle-and-impact">New Forms of Struggle and
Impact</h4>
<p>The militant nationalists put forward several fresh ideas at the
theoretical, propaganda, and programme levels. Among the several forms
of struggle thrown up by the movement were the following:</p>
<p><strong>Boycott of Foreign Goods</strong></p>
<p>Boycott included boycott and public burning of foreign cloth, boycott
of foreign-made salt or sugar, refusal by priests to ritualise marriages
involving exchange of foreign goods, refusal by washermen to wash
foreign clothes. This form of protest met with great success at the
practical and popular level.</p>
<p><strong>Public Meetings and Processions</strong></p>
<p>Public meetings and processions emerged as major methods of mass
mobilisation. Simultaneously, they were forms of popular expression.</p>
<p><strong>Corps of Volunteers or ‘Samitis’</strong></p>
<p>Samitis such as the Swadesh Bandhab Samiti of Ashwini Kumar Dutta (in
Barisal) emerged as a very popular and powerful means of mass
mobilisation. In Tirunelveli, Tamil Nadu, V.O. Chidambaram Pillai,
Subramania Siva, and some lawyers formed the Swadeshi Sangam which
inspired the local masses. These samitis generated political
consciousness among the masses through magic lantern lectures, swadeshi
songs, providing physical and moral training to their members, social
work during famines and epidemics, organisation of schools, and training
in swadeshi crafts and arbitration courts.</p>
<p><strong>Imaginative use of Traditional Popular Festivals and
Melas</strong></p>
<p>The idea was to use traditional festivals and occasions as a means of
reaching out to the masses and spreading political messages. For
instance, Tilak’s Ganapati and Shivaji festivals became a medium of
swadeshi propaganda not only in western India but also in Bengal . In
Bengal also, the traditional folk theatre forms were used for this
purpose.</p>
<p>#<strong>Emphasis Given to Self-Reliance</strong></p>
<p>Self-reliance or ‘atma shakti’ was encouraged. This implied
re-assertion of national dignity, honour and, confidence and social and
economic regeneration of the villages. In practical terms, it included
social reform and campaigns against caste oppression, early marriage,
dowry system, consumption of alcohol, etc.</p>
<p>#<strong>Programme of Swadeshi or National Education</strong></p>
<p>The movement to boycott British educational institutions gathered
momentum in the wake of the British government’s efforts to suppress the
participation of students in the Swadeshi Movement and the threat to
stop grants, affiliation, and scholarships of the institutions that were
dominated by nationalists. The British action led to the founding of
national schools. In this context, it may be recalled that Raja Subodh
Mullick made a contribution of Rs 100,000 towards the foundation of a
national university in Bengal . A National Council of Education was set
up on August 15, 1906, and the Bengal National College and Bengal
Technical Institute were established. The first principal of the Bengal
National College was Aurobindo Ghosh and its first president was
Rashbehari Ghosh. The college was inspired by Tagore’s school at
Shantiniketan which had been set up in 1901. Several more national
schools were established in Bengal and Bihar. Satishchandra Mukherjee’s
role in encouraging national education should not be ignored. His
newspaper Dawn, in circulation since 1897, and his Dawn Society, set up
in 1902, had already been propagating the message of self-help in
industry and education. Mukherjee pioneered the national education
movement by founding the Bhagabat Chatuspathi in 1895. He took a leading
part in the formation of the National Council of Education and later
became a lecturer in the Bengal National College, and its principal when
Aurobindo resigned. The National Council of Education was set up to
organise a system of education—literary, scientific, and technical—on
national lines and under national control. Education was to be imparted
through the vernacular medium. Funds were even raised to send students
to Japan for advanced learning.</p>
<p>#<strong>Swadeshi or Indigenous Enterprises</strong></p>
<p>The swadeshi spirit also found expression in the establishment of
swadeshi textile mills, soap and match factories, tanneries, banks,
insurance companies, shops, etc. These enterprises were based more on
patriotic zeal than on business acumen. V.O. Chidambaram Pillai’s
venture into a national shipbuilding enterprise—Swadeshi Steam
Navigation Company—at Tuticorin, however, gave a challenge to the
British Indian Steam Navigation Company. There had been a consciousness
even in the 1890s that Indian products should be encouraged in the face
of the onslaught of the imported foreign goods. To this effect, members
of the Tagore family and other leaders had been organising melas (fairs)
to exhibit Indian handicrafts and putting up stores for their sale so
that their production could be encouraged. Rabindranath’s Swadeshi
Bhandar (1897), Jogeshchandra Chaudhuri’s Indian Stores (1901), and
Sarala Debi’s Lakshmir Bhandar (1903) were all efforts in this
direction. The Bengal Chemicals factory had been established by
Prafullachandra Ray in 1893, and attempts were made to manufacture
porcelain in 1901, as pointed out by Sumit Sarkar. Such efforts gained
in momentum with the mood of the Swadeshi Movement.</p>
<p>#<strong>Impact in the Cultural Sphere</strong></p>
<p>The nationalists of all hues took inspiration from songs written by
Rabindranath Tagore, Rajnikant Sen, Dwijendralal Ray, Mukunda Das, Syed
Abu Muhammad, and others. Tagore’s Amar Sonar Bangla written on this
occasion was later to inspire the liberation struggle of Bangladesh and
was adopted by it as its national anthem. In Tamil Nadu, Subramania
Bharati wrote Sudesha Geetham. In painting, Abanindranath Tagore broke
the domination of Victorian naturalism over the Indian art scene and
took inspiration from Ajanta, Mughal, and Rajput paintings. Nandalal
Bose, who left a major imprint on Indian art, was the first recipient of
a scholarship offered by the Indian Society of Oriental Art, founded in
1907. In science, Jagdish Chandra Bose, Prafullachandra Roy, and others
pioneered original research which was praised the world over.</p>
<h4 id="views-2">Views</h4>
<p>Swaraj or self-government is essential for the exercise of swadharma.
Without swaraj there could be no social reform, no industrial progress,
no useful education, no fulfilment of national life. That is what we
seek, that is why God has sent us to the world to fulfil Him. —B.G.
Tilak Swadeshism during the days of its potency coloured the entire
texture of our social and domestic life. —Surendranath Banerjea Swaraj
is the fulfilment of the ancient life of India under modern conditions,
the return of satyuga of national greatness, the resumption by her of
her great role of the teacher and guide, self-liberation of the people
for final fulfilment of the Vedantic idea in politics, that is the true
swaraj for India. —Aurobindo Ghosh</p>
<h3 id="extent-of-mass-participation">Extent of Mass Participation</h3>
<p>Students Students came out in large numbers to propagate and practise
swadeshi, and to take a lead in organising picketing of shops selling
foreign goods. Student participation was visible in Bengal ,
Maharashtra, especially in Poona, and in many parts of the South—Guntur,
Madras, Salem. Police adopted a repressive attitude towards the
students. Schools and colleges whose students participated in the
agitation were to be penalised by disaffiliating them or stopping of
grants and privileges to them. Students who were found guilty of
participation were to be disqualified for government jobs or for
government scholarships, and disciplinary action—fine, expulsion,
arrest, beating, etc.— was to be taken against them. Women Women, who
were traditionally home-centred, especially those of the urban middle
classes, took active part in processions and picketing. From now
onwards, they were to play a significant role in the national movement.
Stand of Muslims Some of the Muslims participated— Barrister Abdul
Rasul, Liaqat Hussain, Guznavi, Maulana Azad (who joined one of the
revolutionary terrorist groups); but most of the upper and middle class
Muslims stayed away or, led by Nawab Salimullah of Dacca, supported the
partition on the plea that it would give them a Muslim-majority East
Bengal . To further government interests, the All-India Muslim League
was propped up on December 30, 1905 as an anti- Congress front, and
reactionary elements like Nawab Salimullah of Dacca were encouraged.
Also, the nature of the Swadeshi Movement, with leaders evoking Hindu
festivals and goddesses for inspiration, tended to exclude the Muslims.
Labour Unrest and Trade Unions In the beginning, some strikes were
organised on the issue of rising prices and racial insult, primarily in
the foreign-owned companies. In September 1905, more than 250 Bengal i
clerks of the Burn Company, Howrah, walked out in protest against a
derogatory work regulation. In July 1906, a strike of workers in the
East Indian Railway resulted in the formation of a Railwaymen’s Union.
Between 1906 and 1908, strikes in the jute mills were very frequent, at
times affecting 18 out of 18 mills. Subramania Siva and Chidambaram
Pillai led strikes in Tuticorin and Tirunelveli in a foreign-owned
cotton mill. In Rawalpindi (Punjab), the arsenal and railway workers
went on strike led by Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh. However, by summer
of 1908, the labour unrests subsided under strict action. Thus, the
social base of the movement expanded to include certain sections of the
zamindari, the students, the women, and the lower middle classes in
cities and towns. An attempt was also made to give political expression
to economic grievances of the working class by organising strikes. But
the movement was not able to garner support of the Muslims, especially
the Muslim peasantry, because of a conscious government policy of divide
and rule helped by overlap of class and community at places.</p>
<h4 id="all-india-aspect">All India Aspect</h4>
<p>Movements in support of Bengal ’s unity and the swadeshi and boycott
agitation were organised in many parts of the country. Tilak, who played
a leading role in the spread of the movement outside Bengal , saw in
this the ushering in of a new chapter in the history of the national
movement. He realised that here was a challenge and an opportunity to
organise popular mass struggle against the British rule to unite the
country in a bond of common sympathy.</p>
<h3 id="annulment-of-partition">Annulment of Partition</h3>
<p>It was decided to annul the partition of Bengal in 1911, mainly to
curb the menace of revolutionary terrorism. The annulment came as a rude
shock to the Muslim political elite. It was also decided to shift the
capital to Delhi as a sop to the Muslims, as it was associated with
Muslim glory, but the Muslims were not pleased. Bihar and Orissa were
taken out of Bengal , and Assam was made a separate province.</p>
<h3 id="evaluation-of-the-swadeshi-movement">Evaluation of the Swadeshi
Movement</h3>
<h4 id="the-movement-fizzles-out">The Movement Fizzles Out</h4>
<p>By 1908, the open phase (as different from the underground
revolutionary phase) of the Swadeshi and Boycott movement was almost
over. This was due to many reasons: ● There was severe government
repression ● The movement failed to create an effective organisation or
a party structure. It threw up an entire gamut of techniques that later
came to be associated with Gandhian politics—noncooperation, passive
resistance, filling of British jails, social reform, and constructive
work—but failed to give these techniques a disciplined focus. ● The
movement was rendered leaderless with most of the leaders either
arrested or deported by 1908 and with Aurobindo Ghosh and Bipin Chandra
Pal retiring from active politics. ● Internal squabbles among leaders,
magnified by the Surat split (1907), did much harm to the movement. ●
The movement aroused the people but did not know how to tap the newly
released energy or how to find new forms to give expression to popular
resentment. ● The movement largely remained confined to the upper and
middle classes and zamindars, and failed to reach the masses—especially
the peasantry. ● Non-cooperation and passive resistance remained mere
ideas. ● It is difficult to sustain a mass-based movement at a high
pitch for too long.</p>
<h4 id="movement-a-turning-point">Movement a Turning Point</h4>
<p>Despite its gradual decline into inactivity, the movement was a
turning point in modern Indian history. ● It proved to be a ‘leap
forward’ in more ways than one. Hitherto untouched sections—students,
women, workers, some sections of urban and rural
population—participated. All the major trends of the national movement,
from conservative moderation to political extremism, from revolutionary
activities to incipient socialism, from petitions and prayers to passive
resistance and non-cooperation emerged during the Swadeshi Movement. ●
The richness of the movement was not confined to the political sphere,
but encompassed art, literature, science, and industry also. ● People
were aroused from slumber and now they learned to take bold political
positions and participate in new forms of political work.<br />
● The swadeshi campaign undermined the hegemony of colonial ideas and
institutions. ● The future struggle was to draw heavily from the
experience gained.</p>
<h4 id="moderate-methods-give-way-to-extremist-modes">Moderate Methods
Give Way to Extremist Modes</h4>
<p>With the coming of the Swadeshi and Boycott Movement, it became clear
that the Moderates had outlived their utility and their politics of
petitions and speeches had become obsolete. They had not succeeded in
keeping pace with time, and this was highlighted by their failure to get
the support of the younger generation for their style of politics. Their
failure to work among the masses had meant that their ideas did not take
root among the masses. Even the propaganda by the Moderates did not
reach the masses. No all-India campaigns of the scale of the Swadeshi
and Boycott Movement had been organised earlier by the Moderates and, in
this campaign, they discovered that they were not its leaders, which was
rather natural. The Extremist ideology and its functioning also lacked
consistency. Its advocates ranged from open members and secret
sympathisers to those opposed to any kind of political violence. Its
leaders—Aurobindo, Tilak, B.C. Pal, and Lala Lajpat Rai—had different
perceptions of their goal. For Tilak, swaraj meant some sort of
self-government, while for Aurobindo it meant complete independence from
foreign rule. But at the politico-ideological level, their emphasis on
mass participation and on the need to broaden the social base of the
movement was a progressive improvement upon the Moderate politics. They
raised patriotism from a level of ‘academic pastime’ to one of ‘service
and sacrifice for the country’. But the politically progressive
Extremists proved to be social reactionaries. They had revivalist and
obscurantist undertones attached to their thoughts. Tilak’s opposition
to the Age of Consent Bill (which would have raised the marriageable age
for girls from 10 years to 12 years, even though his objection was
mainly that such reforms must come from people governing themselves and
not under an alien rule), his organising of Ganapati and Shivaji
festivals as national festivals, his support to anti-cow killing
campaigns, etc., portrayed him as a Hindu nationalist. Similarly, B.C.
Pal and Aurobindo spoke of a Hindu nation and Hindu interests. This
alienated many Muslims from the movement. Though the seemingly
revivalist and obscurantist tactics of the Extremists were directed
against the foreign rulers, they had the effect of promoting a very
unhealthy relationship between politics and religion, the bitter

<p>The Congress split at Surat came in December 1907, around the time
when revolutionary activity had gained momentum. The two events were not
unconnected.</p>
<h4 id="run-up-to-surat">Run-up to Surat</h4>
<p>In December 1905, at the Benaras session of the Indian National
Congress presided over by Gokhale, the Moderate- Extremist differences
came to the fore. The Extremists wanted to extend the Boycott and
Swadeshi Movement to regions outside Bengal and also to include all
forms of associations (such as government service, law courts,
legislative councils, etc.) within the boycott programme and thus start
a nationwide mass movement. The Extremists wanted a strong resolution
supporting their programme at the Benaras session. The Moderates, on the
other hand, were not in favour of extending the movement beyond Bengal
and were totally opposed to boycott of councils and similar
associations. They advocated constitutional methods to protest against
the partition of Bengal . As a compromise, a relatively mild resolution
condemning the partition of Bengal and the reactionary policies of
Curzon and supporting the swadeshi and boycott programme in Bengal was
passed. This succeeded in averting a split for the moment. At the
Calcutta session of the Congress in December 1906, the Moderate
enthusiasm had cooled a bit because of the popularity of the Extremists
and the revolutionaries and because of communal riots. Here, the
Extremists wanted either Tilak or Lajpat Rai as the president, while the
Moderates proposed the name of Dadabhai Naoroji, who was widely
respected by all the nationalists. Finally, Dadabhai Naoroji was elected
as the president and as a concession to the militants, the goal of the
Indian National Congress was defined as ‘swarajya or self-government’
like the United Kingdom or the colonies of Australia and Canada. Also, a
resolution supporting the programme of swadeshi, boycott, and national
education was passed. The word ‘swaraj’ was mentioned for the first
time, but its connotation was not spelt out, which left the field open
for differing interpretations by the Moderates and the Extremists. T he
Extremists, encouraged by the proceedings at the Calcutta session, gave
a call for wide passive resistance and boycott of schools, colleges,
legislative councils, municipalities, law courts, etc. The Moderates,
encouraged by the news that council reforms were on the anvil, decided
to tone down the Calcutta programme. The two sides seemed to be heading
for a showdown. The Extremists thought that the people had been aroused
and the battle for freedom had begun. They felt the time had come for
the big push to drive the British out and considered the Moderates to be
a drag on the movement. They decided that it was necessary to part
company with the Moderates, even if it meant a split in the Congress.
The Moderates thought that it would be dangerous at that stage to
associate with the Extremists whose antiimperialist agitation, it was
felt, would be ruthlessly suppressed by the mighty colonial forces. The
Moderates saw in the council reforms an opportunity to realise their
dream of Indian participation in the administration. Any hasty action by
the Congress, the Moderates felt, under Extremist pressure was bound to
annoy the Liberals, then in power in England. The Moderates were also
ready to part company with the Extremists. The Moderates failed to
realise that the council reforms were meant by the government more to
isolate the Extremists than to reward the Moderates. The Extremists did
not realise that the Moderates could act as their front line of defence
against state repression. And neither side realised that in a vast
country like India ruled by a strong imperialist power, only a
broad-based nationalist movement could succeed.</p>
<h4 id="split-takes-place">Split Takes Place</h4>
<p>The Extremists wanted the 1907 session to be held in Nagpur (Central
Provinces) with Tilak or Lajpat Rai as the president along with a
reiteration of the swadeshi, boycott, and national education
resolutions. The Moderates wanted the session at Surat in order to
exclude Tilak from the presidency, since a leader from the host province
could not be session president (Surat being in Tilak’s home province of
Bombay). Instead, they wanted Rashbehari Ghosh as the president and s
ought to drop the resolutions on swadeshi, boycott, and national
education. Both sides adopted rigid positions, leaving no room for
compromise. The split became inevitable, and the Congress was now
dominated by the Moderates who lost no time in reiterating Congress’
commitment to the goal of self-government within the British Empire and
to the use of constitutional methods only to achieve this goal.</p>
<h4 id="government-repression">Government Repression</h4>
<p>The government launched a massive attack on the Extremists. Between
1907 and 1911, five new laws were brought into force to check
anti-government activity. These legislations included the Seditious
Meetings Act, 1907; Indian Newspapers (Incitement to Offences) Act,
1908; Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1908; and the Indian Press Act, 1910.
Tilak, the main Extremist leader, was tried in 1909 for sedition for
what he had written in 1908 in his Kesari about a bomb thrown by Bengal
revolutionaries in Muzaffarpur, resulting in the death of two innocent
European women. Tilak had written: “This, no doubt, will inspire many
with hatred against the people belonging to the party of rebels. It is
not possible to cause British rule to disappear from this country by
such monstrous deeds. But rulers who exercise unrestricted power must
always remember that there is also a limit to the patience of humanity …
many newspapers had warned the government that if they resorted to
Russian methods, then Indians too will be compelled to imitate the
Russian methods.” In another article, Tilak wrote that the real means of
stopping the bombs consisted in making a beginning towards the grant of
rights of ‘Swarajya’ to the people. Tilak was again arrested; judged
guilty, and sentenced to six years’ transportation and a fine of Rs
1,000. He was sent to Mandalay (Burma) jail for six years. When the
judge asked Tilak if he had anything to say, Tilak said: “In spite of
the v erdict of the jury, I maintain that I am innocent. There are
higher powers that rule the destiny of men and nations and it may be the
will of providence that the cause which I represent may prosper more by
my suffering than my remaining free.” (In 1956, the then Chief Justice
of Bombay High Court, M.C. Chagla, unveiled a marble plaque with these
words engraved on it outside the central courtroom – courtroom 46 –
where Tilak was tried in the Bombay High Court.) Aurobindo and B.C. Pal
retired from active politics. Lajpat Rai left for abroad. The Extremists
were not able to organise an effective alternative party to sustain the
movement. The Moderates were left with no popular base or support,
especially as the youth rallied behind the Extremists. After 1908, the
national movement as a whole declined for a time. In 1914, Tilak was
released and he picked up the threads of the movement.</p>
<h4 id="view-1">View</h4>
<p>”…the mischief of the trial and condemnation of Tilak would be
greater than if you left him alone”. —John Morley, Secretary of State
for India in a letter to Sydenham, Governor of Bombay</p>
<h3 id="the-government-strategy">The Government Strategy</h3>
<p>The British government in India had been hostile to the Congress from
the beginning. Even after the Moderates, who dominated the Congress from
the beginning, began distancing themselves from the militant nationalist
trend which had become visible during the last decade of the 19th
century itself, government hostility did not stop. This was because, in
the government’s view, the Moderates still represented an
anti-imperialist force consisting of basically patriotic and liberal
intellectuals. With the coming of Swadeshi and Boycott Movement and the
emergence of militant nationalist trend in a big way, the government
modified its strategy towards the nationalists. Now, the policy was to
be of ‘rallying them’ (John Morley— the secretary of state) or the
policy of ‘carrot and stick’. It may be described as a three-pronged
approach of repressionconciliation- suppression. In the first stage, the
Extremists were to be repressed mildly, mainly to frighten the
Moderates. In the second stage, the Moderates were to be placated
through some concessions, and hints were to be dropped that m ore
reforms would be forthcoming if the distance from the Extremists was
maintained. This was aimed at isolating the Extremists: With the
Moderates on its side, the government could suppress the Extremists with
its full might; the Moderates could then be ignored. Unfortunately,
neither the Moderates nor the Extremists understood the purpose behind
the strategy. The Surat split suggested that the policy of carrot and
stick had brought rich dividends to the British India government.</p>
<h3 id="morley-minto-reforms-of-1909">Morley-Minto Reforms of 1909</h3>
<p>In October 1906, a group of Muslim elites called the Simla
Deputation, led by the Agha Khan, met Lord Minto and demanded separate
electorates for the Muslims and representation in excess of their
numerical strength in view of ‘the value of the contribution’ Muslims
were making ‘to the defence of the empire’. The same group quickly took
over the Muslim League, initially floated by Nawab Salimullah of Dacca
along with Nawabs Mohsin-ul-Mulk and Waqar-ul- Mulk in December 1906.
The Muslim League intended to preach loyalty to the empire and to keep
the Muslim intelligentsia away from the Congress. Gopal Krishna Gokhale
also went to England to meet the Secretary of State for India, John
Morley, to put Congress demands of self-governing system similar to that
in the other British colonies.</p>
<h4 id="the-reforms">The Reforms</h4>
<p>The viceroy, Lord Minto, and the Secretary of State for India, John
Morley, agreed that some reforms were due so as to placate the Moderates
as well as the Muslims. They worked out a set of measures that came to
be known as the Morley- Minto (or Minto-Morley) Reforms that translated
into the Indian Councils Act of 1909. ● The elective principle was
recognised for the nonofficial membership of the councils in India.
Indians were allowed to participate in the election of various
legislative councils, though on the basis of class and community. ● For
the first time, separate electorates for Muslims for election to the
central council was established—a most detrimental step for India. ● The
number of elected members in the Imperial Legislative Council and the
Provincial Legislative Councils was increased. In the provincial
councils, non-official majority was introduced, but since some of these
non-officials were nominated and not elected, the overall non-elected
majority remained. ● According to Sumit Sarkar, in the Imperial
Legislative Council, of the total 69 members, 37 were to be the
officials and of the 32 non-officials, 5 were to be nominated. Of the 27
elected non-officials, 8 seats were reserved for the Muslims under
separate electorates (only Muslims could vote here for the Muslim
candidates), while 4 seats were reserved for the British capitalists, 2
for the landlords, and 13 seats came under general electorate. ● The
elected members were to be indirectly elected. The local bodies were to
elect an electoral college, which in turn would elect members of
provincial legislatures, who, in turn, would elect members of the
central legislature. ● Besides separate electorates for the Muslims,
representation in excess of the strength of their population was
accorded to the Muslims. Also, the income qualification for Muslim
voters was kept lower than that for Hindus. ● Powers of
legislatures—both at the centre and in provinces—were enlarged and the
legislatures could now pass resolutions (which may or may not be
accepted), ask questions and supplementaries, vote separate items in the
budget though the budget as a whole could not be voted upon. ● One
Indian was to be appointed to the viceroy’s executive council (Satyendra
Sinha was the first Indian to be appointed in 1909).</p>

Lord Morley The reforms 1909 afforded no answer, and could afford no

round them, isolating them from the rest of India and reversing the
unifying and amalgamating process which &gt; d been going on for
centuries… The barrier was a small one at first, for the electorates
were very limited, but with every extension &gt; franchise it grew and

<h4 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h4>
<p>The reforms of 1909 afforded no answer to the Indian political
problem. Lord Morley made it clear that colonial self-government (as
demanded by the Congress) was not suitable for India, and he was against
the introduction of parliamentary or responsible government in India. He
said, “If it could be said that this chapter of reforms led directly or
indirectly to the establishment of a parliamentary system in India, I,
for one, would have nothing at all to do with it.” The ‘constitutional’
reforms were, in fact, aimed at dividing the nationalist ranks by
confusing the Moderates and at checking the growth of unity among
Indians through the obnoxious instrument of separate electorates. The
government aimed at rallying the Moderates and the Muslims against the
rising tide of nationalism. The officials and the Muslim leaders often
talked of the entire community when they talked of the separate
electorates, but in reality it meant the appeasement of just a small
section of the Muslim elite. Besides, the system of election was too
indirect and it gave the impression of “infiltration of legislators
through a number of sieves”. And, while parliamentary forms were
introduced, no responsibility was conceded, which sometimes led to
thoughtless and irresponsible criticism of the government. Only some
members like Gokhale put to constructive use the opportunity to debate
in the councils by demanding universal primary education, attacking
repressive policies, and drawing attention to the plight of indentured
labour and Indian workers in South Africa. What the reforms of 1909 gave
to the people of the country was a shadow rather than substance. The
people had demanded self-government, but what they were given instead
was ‘benevolent despotism’.</p>
