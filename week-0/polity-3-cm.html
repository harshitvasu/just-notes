    <h1 id="chief-minister">32 - <strong>Chief Minister</strong></h1>
<p>In the scheme of parliamentary system of government provided by the
<strong>Constitution</strong>, the <strong>governor</strong> is the
nominal executive authority (<strong>de jure executive</strong>) and the
<strong>Chief Minister</strong> is the real executive authority
(<strong>de facto executive</strong>). In other words, the governor is
the <strong>head of the state</strong> while the Chief Minister is the
<strong>head of the government</strong>. Thus the position of the Chief
Minister at the state level is analogous to the position of
<strong>prime minister</strong> at the Centre.</p>
<h4 id="appointment-of-chief-minister"><strong>Appointment of Chief
Minister</strong></h4>
<p>The <strong>Constitution</strong> does not contain any specific
procedure for the selection and appointment of the Chief Minister.
<strong>Article 164</strong> only says that the Chief Minister shall be
appointed by the governor. However, this does not imply that the
governor is free to appoint any one as the Chief Minister. In accordance
with the conventions of the parliamentary system of government, the
governor has to appoint the <strong>leader of the majority
party</strong> in the <strong>state legislative assembly</strong> as the
Chief Minister. But, when no party has a clear majority in the assembly,
then the governor may exercise his <strong>personal discretion</strong>
in the selection and appointment of the Chief Minister. In such a
situation, the governor usually appoints the leader of the
<strong>largest party</strong> or <strong>coalition</strong> in the
assembly as the Chief Minister and ask him to seek a vote of confidence
in the House within a month.</p>
<p>The governor may have to exercise his individual judgement in the
selection and appointment of the Chief Minister when the Chief Minister
in office dies suddenly and there is no obvious successor. However, on
the death of a Chief Minister, the ruling party usually elects a new
leader and the governor has no choice but to appoint him as Chief
Minister.</p>
<p>The Constitution does not require that a person must prove his
majority in the legislative assembly before he is appointed as the Chief
Minister. The governor may first appoint him as the Chief Minister and
then ask him to prove his majority in the legislative assembly within a
reasonable period. This is what has been done in a number of cases.</p>
<p>A person who is not a member of the <strong>state
legislature</strong> can be appointed as Chief Minister for six months,
within which time, he should be elected to the state legislature,
failing which he ceases to be the Chief Minister.</p>
<p>According to the Constitution, the Chief Minister may be a member of
any of the two Houses of a state legislature. Usually, Chief Ministers
have been selected from the <strong>Lower House</strong> (legislative
assembly), but, on a number of occasions, a member of the <strong>Upper
House</strong> (legislative council) has also been appointed as Chief
Minister.</p>
<h4 id="oath-term-and-salary"><strong>Oath, Term and
Salary</strong></h4>
<p>Before the Chief Minister enters his office, the
<strong>governor</strong> administers to him the <strong>oaths of office
and secrecy</strong>. In his oath of office, the Chief Minister
swears:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>to bear true faith and allegiance to the <strong>Constitution of
India</strong>,</li>
<li>to uphold the <strong>sovereignty and integrity of
India</strong>,</li>
<li>to faithfully and conscientiously discharge the duties of his
office, and</li>
<li>to do right to all manner of people in accordance with the
Constitution and the law, without fear or favour, affection or
ill-will.</li>
</ol>
<p>In his <strong>oath of secrecy</strong>, the Chief Minister swears
that he will not directly or indirectly communicate or reveal to any
person(s) any matter that is brought under his consideration or becomes
known to him as a state minister except as may be required for the due
discharge of his duties as such minister.</p>
<p>The term of the Chief Minister is not fixed and he holds office
during the <strong>pleasure of the governor</strong>. However, this does
not mean that the governor can dismiss him at any time. He cannot be
dismissed by the governor as long as he enjoys the <strong>majority
support</strong> in the <strong>legislative assembly</strong>. But, if
he loses the confidence of the assembly, he must resign or the governor
can dismiss him.</p>
<p>The <strong>salary and allowances</strong> of the Chief Minister are
determined by the <strong>state legislature</strong>. In addition to the
salary and allowances, which are payable to a member of the state
legislature, he gets a <strong>sumptuary allowance</strong>,
<strong>free accommodation</strong>, <strong>travelling
allowance</strong>, <strong>medical facilities</strong>, etc.</p>
<h3 id="powers-and-functions-of-chief-minister"><strong>Powers and
Functions of Chief Minister</strong></h3>
<p>The powers and functions of the Chief Minister can be studied under
the following heads:</p>
<h4 id="in-relation-to-council-of-ministers"><strong>In Relation to
Council of Ministers</strong></h4>
<p>The Chief Minister enjoys the following powers as head of the state
council of ministers:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>The <strong>governor</strong> appoints only those persons as
<strong>ministers</strong> who are recommended by the Chief
Minister.</p></li>
<li><p>He allocates and reshuffles the <strong>portfolios</strong> among
ministers.</p></li>
<li><p>He can ask a minister to resign or advise the governor to dismiss
him in case of <strong>difference of opinion</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>He presides over the meetings of the <strong>council of
ministers</strong> and influences its decisions.</p></li>
<li><p>He guides, directs, controls and coordinates the activities of
all the ministers.</p></li>
<li><p>He can bring about the <strong>collapse of the council of
ministers</strong> by resigning from office. Since the Chief Minister is
the head of the council of ministers, his resignation or death
automatically dissolves the council of ministers. The resignation or
death of any other minister, on the other hand, merely creates a
vacancy, which the Chief Minister may or may not like to fill.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="in-relation-to-the-governor"><strong>In Relation to the
Governor</strong></h4>
<p>The Chief Minister enjoys the following powers in relation to the
governor:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>He is the <strong>principal channel of communication</strong>
between the governor and the council of ministers. It is the duty of the
Chief Minister:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><ol type="i">
<li>to communicate to the <strong>Governor</strong> of the state all
decisions of the council of ministers relating to the administration of
the affairs of the state and proposals for legislation;</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="2" type="i">
<li>to furnish such information relating to the administration of the
affairs of the state and proposals for legislation as the governor may
call for; and</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="3" type="i">
<li>if the governor so requires, to submit for the consideration of the
council of ministers any matter on which a decision has been taken by a
minister but which has not been considered by the council.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" type="a">
<li>He <strong>advises the governor</strong> with regard to the
appointment of important officials like <strong>advocate
general</strong>, <strong>chairman</strong> and members of the
<strong>state public service commission</strong>, <strong>state election
commissioner</strong>, and so on.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="in-relation-to-state-legislature"><strong>In Relation to State
Legislature</strong></h4>
<p>The Chief Minister enjoys the following powers as the leader of the
house:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>He <strong>advises the governor</strong> with regard to the
summoning and proroguing of the sessions of the <strong>state
legislature</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>He can recommend the <strong>dissolution of the legislative
assembly</strong> to the governor at any time.</p></li>
<li><p>He <strong>announces the government policies</strong> on the
floor of the house.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="other-powers-and-functions"><strong>Other Powers and
Functions</strong></h4>
<p>In addition, the Chief Minister also performs the following
functions:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>He is the <strong>chairman of the State Planning
Board</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>He acts as a <strong>vice-chairman</strong> of the concerned
<strong>zonal council</strong> by rotation, holding office for a period
of one year at a time.</p></li>
<li><p>He is a member of the <strong>Inter-State Council</strong> and
the <strong>Governing Council of NITI Aayog</strong>, both headed by the
prime minister.</p></li>
<li><p>He is the <strong>chief spokesman</strong> of the state
government.</p></li>
<li><p>He is the <strong>crisis manager-in-chief</strong> at the
political level during emergencies.</p></li>
<li><p>As a leader of the state, he meets various sections of the people
and receives memoranda from them regarding their problems, and so
on.</p></li>
<li><p>He is the <strong>political head of the
services</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, he plays a very significant and highly crucial role in the
state administration. However, the <strong>discretionary powers</strong>
enjoyed by the governor reduce to some extent the power, authority,
influence, prestige, and role of the Chief Minister in the state
administration.</p>
