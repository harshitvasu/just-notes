9 <strong>A General Survey of Socio-Cultural Reform Movements and their
Leaders</strong></h2>
<h3 id="raja-rammohan-roy-and-brahmo-samaj">Raja Rammohan Roy and Brahmo
Samaj</h3>
<p><strong>Raja Rammohan Roy (1772–1833)</strong>, often called the
father of Indian Renaissance and the maker of Modern India, was a man of
versatile genius. Rammohan Roy believed in the modern scientific
approach and principles of human dignity and social equality. He put his
faith in monotheism. He wrote <strong>Gift to Monotheists
(1809)</strong> and translated into Bengali the Vedas and the five
Upanishads to prove his conviction that ancient Hindu texts support
monotheism. In <strong>1814</strong>, he set up the <strong>Atmiya Sabha
(or Society of Friends)</strong> in Calcutta to propagate the
monotheistic ideals of the Vedanta and to campaign against idolatry,
caste rigidities, meaningless rituals, and other social ills. Strongly
influenced by rationalist ideas, he declared that Vedanta is based on
reason and that, if reason demanded it, even a departure from the
scriptures is justified. He said the principles of rationalism applied
to other sects also, particularly to the elements of blind faith in
them. In his <strong>Precepts of Jesus (1820)</strong>, he tried to
separate the moral and philosophical message of the New Testament, which
he praised, from its miracle stories. He earned the wrath of
missionaries over his advocacy to incorporate the message of Christ into
Hinduism. He stood for a creative and intellectual process of selecting
the best from different cultures, over which, again, he faced orthodox
reaction.</p>
<p>Raja Rammohan Roy founded the <strong>Brahmo Sabha</strong> in August
<strong>1828</strong>; it was later renamed <strong>Brahmo
Samaj</strong>. Through the Sabha, he wanted to institutionalize his
ideas and mission. The Samaj was committed to “the worship and adoration
of the Eternal, Unsearchable, Immutable Being who is the Author and
Preserver of the Universe”. Prayers, meditation, and readings of the
Upanishads were to be the forms of worship, and no graven image, statue
or sculpture, carving, painting, picture, portrait, etc., were to be
allowed in the Samaj buildings, thus underlining the Samaj’s opposition
to idolatry and meaningless rituals. The long-term agenda of the Brahmo
Samaj—to purify Hinduism and to preach monotheism—was based on the twin
pillars of reason and the Vedas and Upanishads. The Samaj also tried to
incorporate teachings of other religions and kept its emphasis on human
dignity, opposition to idolatry, and criticism of social evils such as
sati. Rammohan Roy did not want to establish a new religion. He only
wanted to purify Hinduism of the evil practices which had crept into it.
Roy’s progressive ideas met with strong opposition from orthodox
elements like <strong>Raja Radhakant Deb</strong> who organized the
<strong>Dharma Sabha</strong> to counter Brahmo Samaj propaganda.
<strong>Roy’s death in 1833</strong> was a setback for the Samaj’s
mission.</p>
<p><strong>The features of Brahmo Samaj</strong> may be summed up in
this way: - It denounced polytheism and idol worship; - It discarded
faith in divine avataras (incarnations); - It denied that any scripture
could enjoy the status of ultimate authority transcending human reason
and conscience. - It took no definite stand on the doctrine of karma and
transmigration of soul and left it to individual Brahmos to believe
either way. - It criticized the caste system.</p>
<h3 id="raja-rammohan-roys-efforts-at-social-reform">Raja Rammohan Roy’s
Efforts at Social Reform</h3>
<p><strong>Rammohan Roy</strong> was a determined advocate against the
abhorrent practice of <strong>sati</strong>. Commencing his anti-sati
campaign in <strong>1818</strong>, he marshaled sacred texts to disprove
any religious sanction for the burning of widows, while appealing to
<strong>humanity, reason, and compassion</strong>. His activism extended
to visiting cremation grounds, organizing vigilance groups, and
submitting counter petitions to the government. His relentless efforts
bore fruit with the <strong>Government Regulation of 1829</strong>,
which outlawed sati.</p>
<p>As a fervent campaigner for <strong>women’s rights</strong>, Roy
confronted the widespread subjugation of women, challenging
misconceptions that perpetuated their inferior social status. He
vehemently opposed practices like <strong>polygamy</strong> and
advocated for the rights of widows, including the right to
<strong>inheritance and property</strong>.</p>
<p>Roy played a pivotal role in advancing <strong>modern
education</strong> in India. Supporting <strong>David Hare’s</strong>
initiative to establish the <strong>Hindu College</strong> in
<strong>1817</strong>, he promoted a curriculum blending Indian and
Western knowledge. His linguistic acumen, spanning languages such as
<strong>Sanskrit, Persian, Arabic, English, French, Latin,
Greek</strong>, and <strong>Hebrew</strong>, facilitated his
intellectual pursuits.</p>
<p>As a staunch advocate of <strong>freedom of the Press</strong>, Roy
pioneered Indian journalism, publishing newspapers in multiple languages
to educate the public and voice grievances against the government. His
activism extended to political arenas, where he challenged oppressive
practices, advocated for <strong>land reforms</strong> and reduction of
<strong>export duties</strong>, and demanded <strong>judicial
equality</strong> between Indians and Europeans.</p>
<p>Roy’s vision transcended national boundaries, advocating for
<strong>cooperation among nations</strong> and standing against
oppression globally. His support for revolutions in
<strong>Naples</strong> and <strong>Spanish America</strong>, as well as
his condemnation of English landlordism in <strong>Ireland</strong>,
demonstrated his commitment to <strong>universal principles of liberty,
equality, and justice</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Associates</strong> like <strong>David Hare</strong>,
<strong>Alexander Duff</strong>, <strong>Debendranath Tagore</strong>,
<strong>P.K. Tagore</strong>, <strong>Chandrashekhar Deb</strong>, and
<strong>Tarachand Chakraborty</strong> played significant roles in Roy’s
endeavors, enriching the collaborative spirit of his reformist
movement.</p>
<h3 id="debendranath-tagore-and-brahmo-samaj">Debendranath Tagore and
Brahmo Samaj</h3>
<p><strong>Maharishi Debendranath Tagore (1817–1905)</strong>, father of
<strong>Rabindranath Tagore</strong> and a product of the best in
traditional Indian learning and Western thought, gave a new life to
Brahmo Samaj and a definite form and shape to the <strong>theist
movement</strong>, when he <strong>joined the Samaj in 1842</strong>.
Earlier, Tagore headed the <strong>Tattvabodhini Sabha</strong> (founded
in <strong>1839</strong>) which, along with its organ
<strong>Tattvabodhini Patrika</strong> in Bengali, was devoted to the
systematic study of India’s past with a rational outlook and to the
propagation of <strong>Rammohan’s ideas</strong>. A new vitality and
strength of membership came to be associated with the Brahmo Samaj due
to the informal association of the two sabhas. Gradually, the Brahmo
Samaj came to include prominent followers of Rammohan, the
<strong>Derozians</strong> and independent thinkers such as
<strong>Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar</strong> and <strong>Ashwini Kumar
Datta</strong>. Tagore worked on two fronts: within Hinduism, the Brahmo
Samaj was a <strong>reformist movement</strong>; outside, it resolutely
<strong>opposed the Christian missionaries</strong> for their criticism
of Hinduism and their attempts at conversion. The revitalised Samaj
supported <strong>widow remarriage</strong>, <strong>women’s
education</strong>, <strong>abolition of polygamy</strong>, improvement
in <strong>ryots’ conditions</strong>, and
<strong>temperance</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="keshab-chandra-sen-and-the-brahmo-samaj">Keshab Chandra Sen and
the Brahmo Samaj</h3>
<p>The <strong>Brahmo Samaj</strong> experienced another phase of energy
when <strong>Keshab Chandra Sen</strong> (1838–84) was made the
<strong>acharya</strong> by <strong>Debendranath Tagore</strong> soon
after the former joined the Samaj in <strong>1858</strong>.
<strong>Keshab</strong> (also spelt <strong>Keshub</strong>) was
instrumental in popularising the movement, and branches of the Samaj
were opened outside <strong>Bengal</strong>—in the <strong>United
Provinces</strong>, <strong>Punjab</strong>, <strong>Bombay</strong>,
<strong>Madras</strong>, and other towns. Unfortunately, Debendranath
did not like some of Sen’s ideas which he found too radical, such as
cosmopolitanisation of the Samaj’s meetings by inclusion of teachings
from all religions and his strong views against the <strong>caste
system</strong>, even open support to <strong>inter-caste
marriages</strong>. <strong>Keshab Chandra Sen</strong> was dismissed
from the office of <strong>acharya</strong> in <strong>1865</strong>.
Keshab and his followers founded the <strong>Brahmo Samaj of
India</strong> in <strong>1866</strong>, while Debendranath Tagore’s
Samaj came to be known as the <strong>Adi Brahmo Samaj</strong>. In
<strong>1878</strong>, Keshab’s inexplicable act of getting his
<strong>13-year-old daughter</strong> married to the minor <strong>Hindu
Maharaja of Cooch-Behar</strong> with all the orthodox Hindu rituals
caused another split in Keshab’s Brahmo Samaj of India. Earlier, Keshab
had begun to be considered as an <strong>incarnation</strong> by some of
his followers, much to the dislike of his progressive followers.
Further, Keshab had begun to be accused of
<strong>authoritarianism</strong>. After <strong>1878</strong>, the
disgusted followers of Keshab set up a new organisation, the
<strong>Sadharan Brahmo Samaj</strong>. The Sadharan Brahmo Samaj was
started by <strong>Ananda Mohan Bose</strong>, <strong>Sib Chandra
Deb</strong>, and <strong>Umeshchandra Dutta</strong>. It reiterated the
Brahmo doctrines of faith in a <strong>Supreme being</strong>, one
<strong>God</strong>, the belief that no scripture or man is infallible,
and belief in the dictates of <strong>reason</strong>,
<strong>truth</strong>, and <strong>morality</strong>. A number of
Brahmo centres were opened in <strong>Madras province</strong>. In
<strong>Punjab</strong>, the <strong>Dayal Singh Trust</strong> sought
to implant Brahmo ideas by the opening of <strong>Dayal Singh
College</strong> at <strong>Lahore</strong> in
<strong>1910</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="significance-of-the-brahmo-samaj">Significance of the Brahmo
Samaj</h3>
<p>In matters of social reform, the <strong>Samaj</strong> attacked many
<strong>dogmas</strong> and <strong>superstitions</strong>. It condemned
the prevailing <strong>Hindu prejudice against going abroad</strong>. It
worked for a respectable status for women in society—condemned
<strong>sati</strong>, worked for the abolition of the <strong>purdah
system</strong>, discouraged <strong>child marriage</strong> and
<strong>polygamy</strong>, crusaded for <strong>widow
remarriage</strong> and for provisions of <strong>educational
facilities</strong>. It also attacked <strong>casteism</strong> and
<strong>untouchability</strong>, though in these matters it attained
only limited success. The influence of the <strong>Brahmo
Samaj</strong>, however, did not go much beyond
<strong>Calcutta</strong> and, at most, <strong>Bengal</strong>. It did
not have a lasting impact.</p>
<h3 id="prarthana-samaj">Prarthana Samaj</h3>
<p>In <strong>1867</strong>, <strong>Keshab Chandra Sen</strong> helped
<strong>Atmaram Pandurang</strong> found the <strong>Prarthana
Samaj</strong> in <strong>Bombay</strong>. Earlier, the Brahmo ideas
spread in <strong>Maharashtra</strong>. A precursor of the Prarthana
Samaj was the <strong>Paramahansa Sabha</strong>, something like a
secret society to spread liberal ideas and encourage the breakdown of
<strong>caste</strong> and <strong>communal barriers</strong>.
<strong>Mahadeo Govind Ranade</strong> (1842–1901) joined the samaj in
<strong>1870</strong>, and much of the popularity of and work done by
the society was due to his efforts. His efforts made the samaj gain an
all-India character. Other leaders of the samaj were <strong>R.G.
Bhandarkar</strong> (1837–1925) and <strong>N.G. Chandavarkar</strong>
(1855–1923). The emphasis was on <strong>monotheism</strong>, but on the
whole, the samaj was more concerned with <strong>social reforms</strong>
than with religion. The Prarthana Sabha was very attached to the
<strong>bhakti cult</strong> of Maharashtra. The samaj relied on
<strong>education</strong> and <strong>persuasion</strong> and not on
confrontation with <strong>Hindu orthodoxy</strong>. There was a
four-point social agenda also: 1. Disapproval of <strong>caste
system</strong> 2. <strong>Women’s education</strong> 3. <strong>Widow
remarriage</strong> 4. Raising the <strong>age of marriage</strong> for
both males and females. <strong>Dhondo Keshav Karve</strong> and
<strong>Vishnu Shastri</strong> were champions of social reform with
Ranade. Along with Karve, Ranade founded the <strong>Widow Remarriage
Movement</strong> as well as the <strong>Widows’ Home
Association</strong> with the aim of providing education and training to
widows so that they could support themselves.</p>
<h3 id="young-bengal-movement-and-henry-vivian-derozio">Young Bengal
Movement and Henry Vivian Derozio</h3>
<p>During the late <strong>1820s</strong> and early
<strong>1830s</strong>, there emerged a radical, intellectual trend
among the youth in <strong>Bengal</strong>, which came to be known as
the <strong>Young Bengal Movement</strong>. A young Anglo-Indian,
<strong>Henry Vivian Derozio</strong> (1809–31), who taught at the
<strong>Hindu College</strong> from <strong>1826</strong> to
<strong>1831</strong>, was the leader and inspirer of this progressive
trend. Drawing inspiration from the <strong>great French
Revolution</strong>, Derozio inspired his pupils to think freely and
rationally, question all authority, love <strong>liberty</strong>,
<strong>equality</strong>, and <strong>freedom</strong>, and oppose
decadent customs and traditions. The <strong>Derozians</strong> also
supported <strong>women’s rights</strong> and
<strong>education</strong>. Also, Derozio was perhaps the first
<strong>nationalist poet</strong> of modern India.</p>
<p>The <strong>Derozians</strong>, however, failed to have a long-term
impact. Derozio was removed from the Hindu College in
<strong>1831</strong> because of his radicalism. The main reason for
their limited success was the prevailing social conditions at that time,
which were not ripe for the adoption of radical ideas. Further, there
was no support from any other social group or class. The Derozians
lacked any real link with the masses; for instance, they failed to take
up the <strong>peasants’ cause</strong>. In fact, their radicalism was
bookish in character. But, despite their limitations, the Derozians
carried forward <strong>Rammohan Roy’s</strong> tradition of public
education on social, economic, and political questions. For instance,
they demanded induction of <strong>Indians in higher grades of
services</strong>, protection of <strong>ryots</strong> from oppressive
<strong>zamindars</strong>, better treatment to <strong>Indian labour
abroad in British colonies</strong>, revision of the <strong>Company’s
charter</strong>, freedom of <strong>press</strong>, and <strong>trial
by jury</strong>.</p>
<p>Later, <strong>Surendranath Banerjea</strong> was to describe the
Derozians as “the pioneers of the modern civilisation of Bengal, the
conscript fathers of our race whose virtues will excite veneration and
whose failings will be treated with gentlest consideration.”</p>
<h3 id="ishwar-chandra-vidyasagar">Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar</h3>
<p>The great scholar and reformer, <strong>Vidyasagar</strong>, blended
<strong>Indian</strong> and <strong>Western thought</strong>
harmoniously. He believed in high <strong>moral values</strong>, was a
deep <strong>humanist</strong>, and was generous to the poor. In
<strong>1850</strong>, he became the principal of <strong>Sanskrit
College</strong>. Determined to break the <strong>priestly
monopoly</strong> of scriptural knowledge, he opened the Sanskrit
College to <strong>non-brahmins</strong>. He introduced <strong>Western
thought</strong> in Sanskrit College to break the self-imposed isolation
of <strong>Sanskritic learning</strong>. As an academician, he evolved a
new methodology to teach Sanskrit. He also devised a new <strong>Bengali
primer</strong> and evolved a new <strong>prose style</strong>.</p>
<p>Vidyasagar started a movement in support of <strong>widow
remarriage</strong>, which resulted in its legalisation. He was also a
crusader against <strong>child marriage</strong> and
<strong>polygamy</strong>. He did much for the cause of <strong>women’s
education</strong>. As government inspector of schools, he helped
organise <strong>35 girls’ schools</strong>, many of which he ran at his
own expense. As secretary of <strong>Bethune School</strong>
(established in <strong>1849</strong>), he was one of the pioneers of
higher education for women in India.</p>
<p>The <strong>Bethune School</strong>, founded in
<strong>Calcutta</strong>, was the result of the powerful movement for
women’s education that arose in the <strong>1840s</strong> and
<strong>1850s</strong>. The movement faced great difficulties. The young
students were shouted at and abused, and sometimes even their parents
were subjected to <strong>social boycott</strong>. Many believed that
girls who had received <strong>Western education</strong> would make
slaves of their husbands. ### Balshastri Jambhekar <strong>Balshastri
Jambhekar</strong> (1812–46) was a pioneer of <strong>social reform
through journalism</strong> in <strong>Bombay</strong>; he attacked
<strong>brahminical orthodoxy</strong> and tried to reform popular
<strong>Hinduism</strong>. He started the newspaper
<strong>Darpan</strong> in <strong>1832</strong>. Known as the
<strong>father of Marathi journalism</strong>, Jambhekar used the Darpan
to awaken the people to awareness of social reforms, such as
<strong>widow remarriage</strong>, and to instill in the masses a
<strong>scientific approach</strong> to life. In <strong>1840</strong>,
he started <strong>Digdarshan</strong>, which published articles on
scientific subjects as well as history.</p>
<p>Jambhekar founded the <strong>Bombay Native General Library</strong>
and started the <strong>Native Improvement Society</strong>, an offshoot
of which was the <strong>Students Literary and Scientific
Library</strong>. He was the first professor of <strong>Hindi</strong>
at <strong>Elphinston College</strong>, besides being a director of the
<strong>Colaba Observatory</strong>. ### Paramahansa Mandali Founded in
<strong>1849</strong> in <strong>Maharashtra</strong>, the founders of
the <strong>Paramahansa Mandali</strong>—<strong>Dadoba
Pandurang</strong>, <strong>Mehtaji Durgaram</strong>, and others—began
as a secret society that worked to reform <strong>Hindu
religion</strong> and <strong>society</strong> in general. The ideology
of the society was closely linked to that of the <strong>Manav Dharma
Sabha</strong>. Besides believing that one god should be worshipped, the
society also said real religion is based on <strong>love</strong> and
<strong>moral conduct</strong>. <strong>Freedom of thought</strong> was
encouraged as was <strong>rationality</strong>. The founders of the
mandali were primarily interested in breaking <strong>caste
rules</strong>. At their meetings, food cooked by <strong>lower caste
people</strong> was taken by the members. These mandalis also advocated
<strong>widow remarriage</strong> and <strong>women’s
education</strong>. Branches of Paramahansa Mandali existed in
<strong>Poona</strong>, <strong>Satara</strong>, and other towns of
Maharashtra.</p>
<h3 id="jyotirao-phule-and-savitribai-phule">Jyotirao Phule and
Savitribai Phule</h3>
<p><strong>Jyotirao</strong> or <strong>Jyotiba Phule</strong>
(<strong>1827–90</strong>), born in <strong>Satara</strong>,
<strong>Maharashtra</strong>, belonged to the <strong>mali (gardener)
community</strong> and organized a powerful movement against upper caste
domination and <strong>brahminical supremacy</strong>. Phule founded the
<strong>Satyashodhak Samaj (Truth Seekers’ Society)</strong> in
<strong>1873</strong>, with the leadership of the samaj coming from the
backward classes, malis, telis, kunbis, saris, and dhangars. The main
aims of the movement were (i) <strong>social service</strong>, and (ii)
<strong>spread of education</strong> among women and lower caste
people.</p>
<p>Phule wanted <strong>social transformation</strong>, not just social
reform. He was of the view that until the oppressed classes or the
masses were educated, there would be no mass awakening, and social
revolution would not be possible. Jyotiba wanted a society free of
exploitation. Many believe that Phule introduced the Marathi word
<strong>‘dalit’</strong> (meaning crushed) to describe those outside the
varna system.</p>
<p>He propagated what came to be called the <strong>Satyashodhak
marriage ceremony</strong> – simple and inexpensive, besides making the
services of the brahmin priest redundant. Phule’s works,
<strong>Sarvajanik Satyadharma</strong> and <strong>Gulamgiri</strong>,
became sources of inspiration for the common masses. Phule used the
symbol of <strong>Rajah Bali</strong> as opposed to the brahmins’ symbol
of <strong>Rama</strong>. Phule aimed at the complete abolition of the
caste system and socio-economic inequalities; he was against Sanskritic
Hinduism. This movement gave a sense of identity to the depressed
communities as a class against those brahmins who used religion and the
blind faith of the masses to exploit the masses for personal monetary
gain.</p>
<p>Jyotiba Phule was given the title of <strong>Mahatma</strong> in
<strong>1888</strong> by another Maharashtrian social reformer,
<strong>Vithalrao Krishnaji Vandekar</strong>. Jyotiba was not allowed
to continue schooling because of his caste. However, with help and
encouragement from the Persian scholar <strong>Ghaffar Baig
Munshi</strong> and a British official, <strong>Lizit Sahab</strong>,
Jyotiba was admitted to a Scottish missionary school. The society of the
day was against the <strong>education of girls</strong> as well. Yet, he
along with his wife, <strong>Savitribai</strong>, were instrumental in
opening a <strong>school for girls</strong> in <strong>Pune</strong>.
The school syllabus included <strong>mathematics</strong>,
<strong>science</strong>, and <strong>social studies</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Savitribai</strong>, also of the <strong>mali
community</strong>, was born in <strong>1831</strong> at
<strong>Naigaon</strong> in Maharashtra’s <strong>Satara
district</strong> and was married to <strong>Jyotiba Phule</strong> when
a child of nine. Jyotiba, a firm believer in <strong>education for
all</strong>, including women, taught his wife at home. Later, she took
a <strong>teacher’s training course</strong>. She faced abuse and
humiliation from the people along the way when she walked to the school
to teach, but she braved it to persist with her vocation.
<strong>Savitribai</strong> also began to teach women and children from
the downtrodden castes, including <strong>Mang</strong> and
<strong>Mahar</strong>. She and her husband established two educational
trusts, namely the <strong>Native Female School, Pune</strong>, and the
<strong>Society for Promoting the Education of Mahars, Mangs, and
others</strong>.</p>
<p>Savitribai went on from <strong>girls’ education</strong> to question
many <strong>social evils</strong> and work towards eradicating them.
She started the <strong>Mahila Seva Mandal</strong> to raise awareness
about <strong>women’s rights</strong>. She and her husband rigorously
campaigned against the <strong>dehumanisation of widows</strong> and
advocated <strong>widow remarriage</strong>. Savitribai is said to have
organized a successful <strong>barbers’ strike</strong> to denounce the
inhumane practice of shaving widows’ heads. With her husband, she set up
a home called <strong>Balhatya Pratibandhak Griha</strong> (home to
prevent infanticide) in <strong>1863</strong>, where unwed mothers and
widows who became pregnant under unfortunate circumstances could have
safe deliveries instead of resorting to killing the infants or
themselves.</p>
<p>Savitribai and her husband set an example against the evil of
<strong>untouchability</strong> by opening their own <strong>water
storage</strong> to everyone. After Jyotiba’s death, Savitribai took
over the <strong>Satya Shodhak Samaj</strong>, presiding over the
meetings, guiding the workers, and working for <strong>plague
victims</strong>. She died in <strong>1897</strong>, getting infected by
the plague while caring for a patient.</p>
<p>Savitribai wrote poetry, and two of her collections are
<strong>Kavyaphule</strong> and <strong>Bavankashi Subodh
Ratnakar</strong>. (In August <strong>2014</strong>, the name of the
<strong>University of Pune</strong> was changed to <strong>Savitribai
Phule Pune University</strong> in honor of Savitribai Phule.)</p>
<h3 id="gopal-baba-walangkar">Gopal Baba Walangkar</h3>
<p><strong>Gopal Baba Walangkar</strong>, also known as <strong>Gopal
Krishna</strong> (circa 1840–1900), was a pioneer in the cause of
uplifting the <strong>Dalits</strong> from the socio-economic oppression
they suffered. Walangkar is generally considered by
<strong>Ambedkar</strong> to be the pioneer of the <strong>Dalit
movement</strong>. Born into a <strong>Mahar family</strong> near
<strong>Mahad</strong> in what is now <strong>Raigad district</strong>
of <strong>Maharashtra</strong>, Gopal Krishna served in the
<strong>army</strong> until he retired in <strong>1886</strong>. He was
deeply influenced by <strong>Jyotiba Phule</strong>.</p>
<p>Walangkar subscribed to Phule’s idea of the <strong>Aryan invasion
theory</strong> and said that the untouchable people of India were the
<strong>indigenous inhabitants</strong> and that the brahmins came from
the invading Aryans. He contended that the concept of
<strong>caste</strong> was contrived by the Aryan invaders to subjugate
and control the <strong>Anaryans</strong> (who were the indigenous
people). He formed a group of <strong>Mahar astrologers</strong> to give
a sense of empowerment to the Mahars and reduce the importance of the
brahmins, as the service of setting the time for ceremonies was the only
one that brahmins had been willing to perform for the Mahars.</p>
<p>Walangkar founded the <strong>Anarya Dosh-Parihar Mandali</strong>
(Society for the Removal of Evils Among the Non-Aryans). It was through
this society that a petition was sought to be raised against the policy
of the government to discontinue the recruitment of Mahars in the
army.</p>
<p>In <strong>1888</strong>, Walangkar began publishing the monthly
journal <strong>Vital Vidhvansak</strong> (Destroyer of Brahmanical or
Ceremonial Pollution). In <strong>1889</strong>, he followed with a
pamphlet, <strong>Vital Viduvansan</strong> (Annihilation of Ceremonial
Pollution), which spoke against the position of untouchables in society.
He has been called “the first intellectual rebel from the Dalit
community to have launched a scathing criticism of the <strong>caste
system</strong> and the position of Dalits in it.” His approach was not
so much a direct opposition to the elites of society; it was rather an
appeal aimed at making them change their attitude. He also wrote
<strong>Hindu Dharma Darpan</strong>, published in
<strong>1894</strong>. He contributed to Marathi language journals such
as <strong>Sudharak</strong> and <strong>Deenbandhu</strong> to arouse
awareness and inspire the depressed classes.</p>
<p>The attitude of the upper castes is manifest in the opposition they
showed when Walangkar was appointed to the local <strong>taluk board of
Mahad</strong> in <strong>1895</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="kisan-faguji-bansod">Kisan Faguji Bansod</h3>
<p><strong>Kisan Faguji Bansod</strong> (1879–1946) was born in a
<strong>Mahar family</strong> at <strong>Mohapa village</strong> near
<strong>Nagpur</strong> in <strong>Maharashtra</strong>. He wanted
<strong>Dalit boys and girls</strong> to be educated and established the
<strong>Chokhamela girls’ school</strong> at <strong>Nagpur</strong>.
Setting up his own press in <strong>1910</strong>, Bansod published the
journals <strong>Nirashrit Hind Nagarik</strong>, <strong>Vital
Vidhvansak</strong>, and <strong>Majur Patrika</strong>. He was one of
the secretaries of the <strong>All India Depressed Classes
Conference</strong> in <strong>1920</strong>.</p>
<p>Bansod was influenced by the <strong>Bhakti cult</strong> and the
work of the <strong>Brahmo Samaj</strong> and the <strong>Prarthana
Samaj</strong>. Though he also subscribed to the theory of the
<strong>enslavement of the Dalits</strong> because of the <strong>Aryan
invasion</strong>, he advocated reforms within <strong>Hinduism</strong>
for the upliftment of the Dalits.</p>
<h3 id="vitthal-ramji-shinde">Vitthal Ramji Shinde</h3>
<p><strong>Maharshi Vitthal Ramji Shinde</strong> (1873–1944) was born
in a <strong>Marathi family</strong> in <strong>Karnataka</strong>. He
was influenced in his spiritual journey by the works of
<strong>Tukaram</strong>, <strong>Eknath</strong>, and
<strong>Ramdas</strong>. Brought up in a liberal intellectual
atmosphere, he was also influenced by <strong>Hari Narayan
Apte</strong>, <strong>Gopal Ganesh Agarkar</strong>, <strong>Mahadev
Govind Ranade</strong>, <strong>Ramakrishna Gopal Bhandarkar</strong>,
and <strong>G.B. Kotkar</strong> among other thinkers. He joined the
<strong>Prarthana Samaj</strong> and worked towards the <strong>removal
of untouchability</strong> in India. He established a <strong>night
school</strong> for the children of untouchables in
<strong>Pune</strong> in <strong>1905</strong>. He established the
<strong>Depressed Classes Mission</strong> in <strong>Bombay</strong> in
<strong>1906</strong>. The mission aimed at eliminating untouchability,
providing <strong>educational facilities</strong> for the untouchables,
and solving their problems.</p>
<p>Shinde gave evidence before the <strong>Southborough Franchise
Committee</strong> in <strong>1919</strong>, expressing the need for
giving special representation to the <strong>untouchable class</strong>.
He resigned as the executive of the <strong>Depressed Classes
Mission</strong> when some members wanted the mission’s affairs to be
managed by their own people. He, however, continued to work for the
depressed classes. He favored a <strong>united front</strong> from the
depressed classes and the caste Hindus, fearing the British rulers would
otherwise exploit divisions in Indian society for their own
advantage.</p>
<p>He expressed his opposition to the <strong>caste system</strong>,
<strong>idol worship</strong>, and inequities forced on women and the
depressed classes, as well as meaningless rituals, the dominance of
<strong>hereditary priesthood</strong>, and the need for a priest to
mediate between a devotee and God.</p>
<p>He took part in the <strong>Civil Disobedience Movement</strong> and
was imprisoned in the <strong>Yerawda Central Jail</strong>. Shinde was
the author of <strong>Bharatiya Asprushyatecha Prashna</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="gopalhari-deshmukh-lokahitawadi">Gopalhari Deshmukh
‘Lokahitawadi’</h3>
<p><strong>Gopalhari Deshmukh</strong> (1823–92) was a <strong>social
reformer</strong> and <strong>rationalist</strong> from
<strong>Maharashtra</strong>. He held the post of a
<strong>judge</strong> under the <strong>British Raj</strong>, but wrote
for a weekly <strong>Prabhakar</strong> under the pen name of
<strong>Lokahitawadi</strong> on social reform issues. He advocated a
reorganization of <strong>Indian society</strong> on rational principles
and modern, humanistic, secular values. He attacked <strong>Hindu
orthodoxy</strong> and supported <strong>social and religious
equality</strong>. He wrote against the evils of the <strong>caste
system</strong>, famously stating, “If religion does not sanction social
reform, then change religion.”</p>
<p>He started a weekly, <strong>Hitechhu</strong>, and also played a
leading role in founding the periodicals <strong>Gyan Prakash</strong>,
<strong>Indu Prakash</strong>, and <strong>Lokahitawadi</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="gopal-ganesh-agarkar">Gopal Ganesh Agarkar</h3>
<p><strong>Gopal Ganesh Agarkar</strong> (1856–95) was an
<strong>educationist</strong> and <strong>social reformer</strong> from
<strong>Maharashtra</strong>. A strong advocate of the power of
<strong>human reason</strong>, he criticized the <strong>blind
dependence on tradition</strong> and false glorification of the past. He
was a co-founder of the <strong>New English School</strong>, the
<strong>Deccan Education Society</strong>, and <strong>Fergusson
College</strong>, where he also served as principal. He was the first
editor of <strong>Kesari</strong>, the journal started by
<strong>Lokmanya Tilak</strong>. Later, he started his own periodical,
<strong>Sudharak</strong>, which spoke against
<strong>untouchability</strong> and the <strong>caste
system</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="the-servants-of-india-society">The Servants of India
Society</h3>
<p><strong>Gopal Krishna Gokhale</strong> (1866–1915), a liberal leader
of the <strong>Indian National Congress</strong>, founded the
<strong>Servants of India Society</strong> in <strong>1905</strong> with
the help of <strong>M.G. Ranade</strong>. The aim of the society was to
train <strong>national missionaries</strong> for the service of India;
to promote, by all constitutional means, the true interests of the
Indian people; and to prepare a cadre of <strong>selfless
workers</strong> who were to devote their lives to the cause of the
country in a religious spirit. In <strong>1911</strong>, the
<strong>Hitavada</strong> began to be published to project the views of
the society. The society chose to remain aloof from political activities
and organizations like the Indian National Congress.</p>
<p>After Gokhale’s death in <strong>1915</strong>, <strong>Srinivasa
Shastri</strong> took over as president. The society still continues to
function, though with a shrunken base, at many places in India. It works
in the field of <strong>education</strong>, providing
<strong>ashram-type schools</strong> for tribal girls and
<strong>balwadis</strong> at many places.</p>
<h3 id="social-service-league">Social Service League</h3>
<p>A follower of <strong>Gokhale</strong>, <strong>Narayan Malhar
Joshi</strong> founded the <strong>Social Service League</strong> in
<strong>Bombay</strong> with the aim of securing better and reasonable
conditions of life and work for the masses. They organized many
<strong>schools</strong>, <strong>libraries</strong>, <strong>reading
rooms</strong>, <strong>day nurseries</strong>, and <strong>cooperative
societies</strong>. Their activities also included <strong>police court
agents’ work</strong>, <strong>legal aid and advice</strong> to the poor
and illiterate, <strong>excursions for slum dwellers</strong>,
facilities for <strong>gymnasia</strong> and <strong>theatrical
performances</strong>, <strong>sanitary work</strong>, <strong>medical
relief</strong>, and <strong>boys’ clubs and scout corps</strong>. Joshi
also founded the <strong>All India Trade Union Congress</strong> in
<strong>1920</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="the-ramakrishna-movement-and-swami-vivekananda">The Ramakrishna
Movement and Swami Vivekananda</h3>
<p>The didactic nationalism of the <strong>Brahmo Samaj</strong>
appealed more to the <strong>intellectual elite</strong> in
<strong>Bengal</strong>, while the average Bengali found more emotional
satisfaction in the <strong>cult of bhakti and yoga</strong>. The
teachings of <strong>Ramakrishna Paramahamsa</strong> (1836–86), a poor
priest at the <strong>Kali temple</strong> in
<strong>Dakshineshwar</strong> (known in childhood as <strong>Gadadhar
Chattopadhyay</strong>), found many followers. Ramakrishna experienced
<strong>spiritual trances (ecstasy)</strong> from a very early age and
is considered to have attained the highest spiritual experience
available to Hindus. He did not write books, but his conversations with
people formed the basis of his teachings. He spoke simply, using
<strong>parables</strong> and <strong>metaphors</strong> drawn from
ordinary life and nature. His teachings were of universal relevance.</p>
<p>Two objectives of the <strong>Ramakrishna movement</strong> were: 1.
To bring into existence a band of <strong>monks</strong> dedicated to a
life of <strong>renunciation</strong> and <strong>practical
spirituality</strong>, from among whom teachers and workers would be
sent out to spread the <strong>universal message of Vedanta</strong> as
illustrated in the life of Ramakrishna. 2. In conjunction with lay
disciples, to carry on <strong>preaching</strong>,
<strong>philanthropic</strong>, and <strong>charitable works</strong>,
looking upon all people, irrespective of <strong>caste</strong>,
<strong>creed</strong>, or <strong>colour</strong>, as manifestations of
the Divine. Ramakrishna himself laid the foundations of the
<strong>Ramakrishna Math</strong> with his young monastic disciples as a
nucleus to fulfil the first objective. The second objective was taken up
by <strong>Swami Vivekananda</strong> after Ramakrishna’s death, when he
founded the <strong>Ramakrishna Mission</strong> in
<strong>1897</strong>. The headquarters of the <strong>Ramakrishna Math
and Mission</strong> are at <strong>Belur</strong> near
<strong>Calcutta</strong>. The two are twin organizations, though
legally and financially separate.</p>
<p>Paramahamsa sought salvation through traditional ways of
<strong>renunciation</strong>, <strong>meditation</strong>, and
<strong>bhakti</strong> amidst increasing westernization and
modernization. He recognized the fundamental <strong>oneness of all
religions</strong> and emphasized that <strong>Krishna</strong>,
<strong>Hari</strong>, <strong>Ram</strong>, <strong>Christ</strong>,
and <strong>Allah</strong> are different names for the same God, and
that there are many ways to God and salvation: “As many faiths, so many
paths.” Paramahamsa’s spirituality and compassion for suffering humanity
inspired those who listened to him. He used to say, “Service of man is
the service of God.” Incidentally, Ramakrishna was married to
<strong>Saradmani Mukherjee</strong>, later known as <strong>Sarada
Devi</strong>. Ramakrishna considered Sarada as the embodiment of the
<strong>Divine Mother</strong>. It was as ‘<strong>holy mother</strong>’
that the disciples also knew her. She played an important role in the
work of the math and encouraged the young disciples in their
mission.</p>
<h4 id="swami-vivekananda">Swami Vivekananda</h4>
<p><strong>Narendranath Datta</strong> (1862–1902), who later came to be
known as <strong>Swami Vivekananda</strong>, spread
<strong>Ramakrishna’s message</strong> and tried to reconcile it to the
needs of contemporary Indian society. He emerged as the preacher of
<strong>neo-Hinduism</strong>. Certain spiritual experiences of
Ramakrishna, the teachings of the <strong>Upanishads</strong> and the
<strong>Gita</strong>, and the examples of the <strong>Buddha</strong>
and <strong>Jesus</strong> are the basis of Vivekananda’s message to the
world about human values. He subscribed to the <strong>Vedanta</strong>,
which he considered a fully rational system with a superior approach.
His mission was to bridge the gulf between <strong>paramartha</strong>
(service) and <strong>vyavahara</strong> (behavior), and between
<strong>spirituality</strong> and day-to-day life.</p>
<p>Vivekananda believed in the fundamental <strong>oneness of
God</strong> and said, “For our own motherland a junction of the two
great systems, <strong>Hinduism and Islam</strong>, is the only hope.”
Emphasizing social action, he declared that <strong>knowledge without
action is useless</strong>. He lamented the isolationist tendencies and
the touch-me-not attitude of Hindus in religious matters. He frowned at
religion’s tacit approval of the <strong>oppression of the poor by the
rich</strong>. He believed that it was an insult to God and humanity to
teach religion to a starving man. He pointed out that the masses needed
two kinds of knowledge—<strong>secular knowledge</strong> about how to
work for their economic uplift and <strong>spiritual knowledge</strong>
to have faith in themselves and strengthen their moral sense. He called
upon his countrymen to imbibe a spirit of <strong>liberty</strong>,
<strong>equality</strong>, and <strong>free thinking</strong>.</p>
<p>At the <strong>Parliament of Religions</strong> held at
<strong>Chicago</strong> in <strong>1893</strong>, Swami Vivekananda
made a great impression on people by his learned interpretations. The
keynote of his opening address was the need for a healthy balance
between <strong>spiritualism and materialism</strong>. Envisaging a new
culture for the whole world, he called for a blend of the materialism of
the West and the spiritualism of the East into a new harmony to produce
happiness for mankind. Vivekananda gave several lectures on
<strong>Vedanta</strong> in the <strong>USA</strong> and in
<strong>London</strong> before returning to India in
<strong>1897</strong>. In India, <strong>Swami Vivekananda</strong>
delivered a series of lectures aimed at infusing the new generation with
a sense of <strong>pride in India’s past</strong>, a new faith in
<strong>India’s culture</strong>, and a rare sense of <strong>confidence
in India’s future</strong>. He sought to bring about a
<strong>unification of Hinduism</strong> by highlighting the common
foundation of its sects, and to make the educated people see the misery
of the downtrodden and work for their uplift through the application of
practical <strong>Vedanta principles</strong>. His emphasis was not only
on <strong>personal salvation</strong> but also on <strong>social good
and reform</strong>.</p>
<p>In <strong>1897</strong>, he founded the <strong>Ramakrishna
Mission</strong>. Vivekananda was a great <strong>humanist</strong> and
used the Mission for <strong>humanitarian relief</strong> and
<strong>social work</strong>. The Mission stands for religious and
social reform. Vivekananda advocated the <strong>doctrine of
service</strong>—the service of all beings. The service of
<strong>jiva</strong> (living beings) is the worship of
<strong>Siva</strong>. Life itself is religion. By service, the
<strong>Divine exists within man</strong>. Vivekananda promoted using
<strong>technology and modern science</strong> in the service of
mankind.</p>
<p>Ever since its inception, the Mission has been running a number of
<strong>schools</strong>, <strong>hospitals</strong>, and
<strong>dispensaries</strong>. It offers help to the afflicted in times
of natural calamities like <strong>earthquakes</strong>,
<strong>famines</strong>, <strong>floods</strong>, and
<strong>epidemics</strong>. The Mission has developed into a
<strong>worldwide organisation</strong>. It is a deeply religious body,
but it is not a <strong>proselytising body</strong>. It does not
consider itself to be a sect of Hinduism. Unlike the <strong>Arya
Samaj</strong>, the Mission recognizes the utility and value of
<strong>image worship</strong> in developing spiritual fervour and
worship of the eternal omnipotent God, although it emphasizes the
essential spirit and not the symbols or rituals. It believes that the
philosophy of Vedanta will make a Christian a better Christian, and a
Hindu a better Hindu. It was in <strong>1898</strong> that Swami
Vivekananda acquired a large piece of land at <strong>Belur</strong>
where the <strong>Ramakrishna Math</strong> was finally shifted and
registered. The <strong>monastic order</strong> is open to all men
without discrimination on the basis of <strong>caste</strong> or
<strong>creed</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Views of Swami Vivekananda</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>“No other religion preaches the dignity of humanity in such a
lofty strain as <strong>Hinduism</strong> and no other religion on earth
treads upon the poor and the low in such a fashion as
Hinduism.”</p></li>
<li><p>“A country where millions have nothing to eat and where a few
thousand holy men and brahmins suck the blood of the poor and do nothing
at all for them, is not a country but a living hell. Is this religion or
a dance of death?”</p></li>
<li><p>“Forget not that the lower classes, the ignorant, the poor, the
illiterate, the cobbler, the sweeper are thy flesh and blood, thy
brothers.”</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dayananda-saraswati-and-arya-samaj">Dayananda Saraswati and Arya
Samaj</h3>
<p>The <strong>Arya Samaj Movement</strong>, revivalist in form though
not in content, was the result of a reaction to <strong>Western
influences</strong>. Its founder, <strong>Dayananda Saraswati</strong>
or <strong>Mulshankar</strong> (<strong>1824–83</strong>), was born in
the old <strong>Morvi state</strong> in <strong>Gujarat</strong> in a
brahmin family. He wandered as an ascetic for 15 years
(<strong>1845–60</strong>) in search of truth. The first <strong>Arya
Samaj</strong> unit was formally set up by him at
<strong>Bombay</strong> in <strong>1875</strong>, and later the
headquarters of the Samaj were established at
<strong>Lahore</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Dayananda’s views</strong> were published in his famous work,
<strong>Satyarth Prakash</strong> (The True Exposition). His vision of
India included a classless and casteless society, a united India
(religiously, socially, and nationally), and an India free from foreign
rule, with <strong>Aryan religion</strong> being the common religion of
all. He took inspiration from the <strong>Vedas</strong> and considered
them to be ‘India’s Rock of Ages’, the infallible and the true original
seed of Hinduism. He gave the slogan <strong>“Back to the
Vedas”</strong>.</p>
<p>Dayananda’s slogan of <strong>‘Back to the Vedas’</strong> was a call
for a revival of <strong>Vedic learning</strong> and <strong>Vedic
purity of religion</strong> and not a revival of <strong>Vedic
times</strong>. He accepted modernity and displayed a patriotic attitude
to national problems.</p>
<p>Dayananda had received education on <strong>Vedanta</strong> from a
blind teacher named <strong>Swami Virajananda</strong> in
<strong>Mathura</strong>. Along with his emphasis on Vedic authority, he
stressed the significance of individual interpretation of the scriptures
and said that every person has the right of access to God. He criticised
later Hindu scriptures such as the <strong>Puranas</strong> and the
ignorant priests for perverting Hinduism.</p>
<p>Dayananda strongly criticised the escapist Hindu belief in
<strong>maya</strong> (illusion) as the running theme of all physical
existence and the aim of human life as a struggle to attain
<strong>moksha</strong> (salvation) through escape from this evil world
to seek union with God. Instead, he advocated that <strong>God, soul,
and matter (prakriti)</strong> were distinct and eternal entities and
every individual had to work out his own salvation in the light of the
eternal principles governing human conduct. Thus, he attacked the
prevalent popular belief that every individual contributed and got back
from the society according to the principles of <strong>niyati</strong>
(destiny). Dayananda believed in the theory of <strong>karma</strong>
and <strong>reincarnation</strong>. But he also said the good deeds
should be primarily for the good of others and not for self.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So far as Bengal is concerned <strong>Vivekananda</strong> may be
regarded as the spiritual father of the modern nationalist
movement.<br />
—<strong>Subash Chandra Bose</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dayananda launched a <strong>frontal attack</strong> on <strong>Hindu
orthodoxy</strong>, <strong>caste rigidities</strong>,
<strong>untouchability</strong>, <strong>idolatry</strong>,
<strong>polytheism</strong>, belief in <strong>magic</strong>,
<strong>charms</strong>, and <strong>animal sacrifices</strong>, taboo
on sea voyages, feeding the de ad through <strong>shraddhas</strong>,
etc. Dayananda subscribed to the Vedic notion of the <strong>chaturvarna
system</strong> in which a person was identified as a
<strong>brahmin</strong>, <strong>kshatriya</strong>,
<strong>vaishya</strong>, or <strong>shudra</strong> not by birth but
according to the occupation and merit of the person. The <strong>Arya
Samaj</strong> fixed the minimum marriageable age at <strong>25 years
for boys</strong> and <strong>16 years for girls</strong>. <strong>Swami
Dayananda</strong> once lamented the Hindu race as “the children of
children”.</p>
<p>The ten guiding principles of the <strong>Arya Samaj</strong>
are—</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>God</strong> is the primary source of all true
knowledge.</li>
<li><strong>God</strong>, as all-truth, all-knowledge, almighty,
immortal, creator of Universe, is alone worthy of worship.</li>
<li>The <strong>Vedas</strong> are the books of true knowledge.</li>
<li>An <strong>Arya</strong> should always be ready to accept truth and
abandon untruth.</li>
<li><strong>Dharma</strong>, that is, due consideration of right and
wrong, should be the guiding principle of all actions.</li>
<li>The principal aim of the <strong>Samaj</strong> is to promote the
world’s well-being in the material, spiritual, and social sense.</li>
<li>Everybody should be treated with <strong>love and
justice</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Ignorance</strong> is to be dispelled and <strong>knowledge
increased</strong>.</li>
<li>One’s own progress should depend on the <strong>uplift of all
others</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Social well-being</strong> of mankind is to be placed above
an individual’s well-being.</li>
</ol>
<p>The <strong>Arya Samaj’s social ideals</strong> comprise, among
others, the <strong>fatherhood of God</strong> and <strong>brotherhood
of Man</strong>, <strong>equality of the sexes</strong>,
<strong>absolute justice</strong> and fair play between man and man and
nation and nation. <strong>Intercaste marriages</strong> and
<strong>widow remarriages</strong> were also encouraged.</p>
<p><strong>Dayananda</strong> also met other reformers of the
time—<strong>Keshab Chandra Sen</strong>, <strong>Ishwar Chandra
Vidyasagar</strong>, <strong>Ranade</strong>, <strong>Deshmukh</strong>,
etc. The <strong>Arya Samaj</strong> came to be known for the
<strong>social service</strong> it rendered in times of calamities such
as earthquakes, famine, and floods. It also took the initiative in
<strong>promoting education</strong>. After the death of
<strong>Dayananda</strong> in <strong>1883</strong>, the work of the
samaj was carried on by illustrious members. <strong>Education</strong>
was an all-important field for the samaj. The <strong>Dayananda
Anglo-Vedic (D.A.V.) College</strong> was established in
<strong>1886</strong> at <strong>Lahore</strong>.</p>
<p>However, a difference of opinion between two groups in the samaj
arose over the curriculum of the D.A.V. College. One group was known as
the <strong>College Party</strong> (some sources say ‘Culture’ Party),
among whose leaders were <strong>Lala Hansraj</strong>, <strong>Lala Lal
Chand</strong>, and <strong>Lala Lajpat Rai</strong>. The other was the
<strong>Mahatma (later Gurukul) Party</strong> led by <strong>Guru Datta
Vidyarthi</strong> and <strong>Lala Munshi Ram</strong> (who later came
to be known as <strong>Swami Shraddhanand</strong>). While the
<strong>College Party</strong> favoured the government curriculum and
<strong>English education</strong> to meet economic and professional
needs, the <strong>Mahatma Party</strong> was interested in introducing
the study of <strong>Sanskrit</strong> and <strong>Vedic
philosophy</strong> in the tradition of ancient gurukuls.</p>
<p>Later, the issue of <strong>vegetarianism</strong> also became a
point of contention: the <strong>College Party</strong> had nothing
against non-vegetarianism, claiming that diet was a personal choice and
it was not mentioned in the principles of the samaj; the <strong>Mahatma
Party</strong> was in favour of all the Aryas being strict vegetarians.
In the end, the Arya Samaj split in <strong>1893</strong> over these
issues.</p>
<p>The <strong>College Party</strong> retained control over the
<strong>D.A.V. School and College</strong>, while the <strong>Arya
Pratinidhi Sabha, Punjab</strong>, and a majority of the local Arya
Samaj branches were taken over by the <strong>Mahatma Party</strong>.
<strong>Swami Shraddhanand</strong> opened the <strong>Gurukul</strong>
in <strong>1900</strong> at <strong>Gujaranwala</strong> (in West
Punjab, now in Pakistan). In <strong>1902</strong>, the Gurukul was
moved to <strong>Kangri near Haridwar</strong>, hence the name,
<strong>Gurukul Kangri</strong>. The gurukul aimed at providing an
indigenous alternative to <strong>Lord Macaulay’s education
policy</strong> by offering education in the areas of <strong>vedic
literature</strong>, <strong>Indian philosophy</strong>, <strong>Indian
culture</strong> as well as <strong>modern sciences and
research</strong>. The Gurukul believed in <strong>radical social
reform</strong>. It founded the <strong>Kanya Mahavidyalaya</strong> at
<strong>Jalandhar</strong> in <strong>1896</strong> and sponsored
education for widows.</p>
<p>The Arya Samaj was able to give <strong>self-respect</strong> and
<strong>self-confidence</strong> to the Hindus, which helped to
undermine the myth of superiority of <strong>whites</strong> and the
<strong>Western culture</strong>. In its zeal to protect the Hindu
society from the onslaught of <strong>Christianity</strong> and
<strong>Islam</strong>, the Samaj started the <strong>shuddhi
(purification) movement</strong> to reconvert to the Hindu fold the
converts to Christianity and Islam. An aggressive campaign of shuddhi
led to increasing <strong>communalisation</strong> of social life during
the <strong>1920s</strong> and later snowballed into <strong>communal
political consciousness</strong>. The shuddhi movement also attempted to
uplift those regarded as <strong>untouchables</strong> and outside the
caste system of Hindus into pure caste Hindus.</p>
<h3 id="seva-sadan">Seva Sadan</h3>
<p>A <strong>Parsi social reformer</strong>, <strong>Behramji M.
Malabari</strong> (<strong>1853–1912</strong>), founded the <strong>Seva
Sadan</strong> in <strong>1908</strong> along with a friend,
<strong>Diwan Dayaram Gidumal</strong>. Malabari spoke vigorously
against <strong>child marriage</strong> and for <strong>widow
remarriage</strong> among Hindus. It was his efforts that led to the
<strong>Age of Consent Act</strong>, regulating the age of consent for
females. Seva Sadan specialized in taking care of those women who were
exploited and then discarded by society. It catered to all castes and
provided the destitute women with <strong>education</strong>, and
<strong>medical</strong> and <strong>welfare services</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>[Behramji Malabari acquired and edited the Indian
Spectator.]</strong></p>
<h3 id="dev-samaj">Dev Samaj</h3>
<p>Founded in <strong>1887</strong> at <strong>Lahore</strong> by
<strong>Shiv Narayan Agnihotri</strong> (<strong>1850–1927</strong>),
earlier a Brahmo follower, <strong>Dev Sadan</strong> is a religious and
social reform society. The society emphasized the <strong>eternity of
the soul</strong>, the <strong>supremacy of the guru</strong>, and the
need for <strong>good action</strong>. It called for ideal social
behavior such as not accepting bribes, avoiding intoxicants and
non-vegetarian food, and keeping away from violent actions. Its
teachings were compiled in a book, <strong>Deva Shastra</strong>.
Agnihotri spoke against <strong>child marriage</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="dharma-sabha">Dharma Sabha</h3>
<p><strong>Radhakant Deb</strong> founded this sabha in
<strong>1830</strong>. An <strong>orthodox society</strong>, it stood
for the preservation of the status quo in <strong>socio-religious
matters</strong>, opposing even the <strong>abolition of sati</strong>.
However, it favored the promotion of <strong>Western education</strong>,
even for girls.</p>
<h3 id="bharat-dharma-mahamandala">Bharat Dharma Mahamandala</h3>
<p>An <strong>all-India organisation</strong> of the orthodox educated
Hindus, it stood for a defense of <strong>orthodox Hinduism</strong>
against the teachings of the <strong>Arya Samajists</strong>, the
<strong>Theosophists</strong>, and the <strong>Ramakrishna
Mission</strong>. Other organisations created to defend orthodox
Hinduism were the <strong>Sanatana Dharma Sabha</strong>
(<strong>1895</strong>), the <strong>Dharma Maha Parishad</strong> in
South India, and <strong>Dharma Mahamandali</strong> in Bengal. These
organisations combined in <strong>1902</strong> to form the single
organisation of <strong>Bharat Dharma Mahamandala</strong>, with
headquarters at <strong>Varanasi</strong>. This organisation sought to
introduce proper management of Hindu religious institutions, open Hindu
educational institutions, etc. <strong>Pandit Madan Mohan
Malaviya</strong> was a prominent figure in this movement.</p>
<h3 id="radhaswami-movement">Radhaswami Movement</h3>
<p><strong>Tulsi Ram</strong>, a banker from <strong>Agra</strong>, also
known as <strong>Shiv Dayal Saheb</strong>, founded this movement in
<strong>1861</strong>. The <strong>Radhaswamis</strong> believe in one
supreme being, the <strong>supremacy of the guru</strong>, a company of
pious people (<strong>satsang</strong>), and a simple social life.
<strong>Spiritual attainment</strong>, they believe, does not call for
renunciation of the worldly life. They consider all religions to be
true. While the sect has no belief in <strong>temples, shrines</strong>,
and <strong>sacred places</strong>, it considers as necessary duties,
works of <strong>faith</strong> and <strong>charity</strong>,
<strong>service</strong> and <strong>prayer</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="sree-narayana-guru-dharma-paripalana-sndp-movement">Sree
Narayana Guru Dharma Paripalana (SNDP) Movement</h3>
<p>The <strong>SNDP movement</strong> was an example of a regional
movement born out of conflict between the depressed classes and upper
castes. It was started by <strong>Sree Narayana Guru Swamy</strong>
(<strong>1856–1928</strong>) among the <strong>Ezhavas of
Kerala</strong>, a backward caste of toddy-tappers considered to be
untouchables and denied education and entry into temples. The Ezhavas
were the single largest caste group in Kerala, constituting 26 percent
of the total population.</p>
<p><strong>Narayana Guru</strong>, himself from the Ezhava caste, took a
stone from the Neyyar river and installed it as a
<strong>Sivalinga</strong> at <strong>Aruvippuram</strong> on
<strong>Sivaratri in 1888</strong>. This act was intended to show that
the consecration of an idol was not the monopoly of the higher castes.
With this, he began a revolution that soon led to the removal of many
discriminations in Kerala’s society. The movement (<strong>Aruvippuram
Movement</strong>) drew the famous poet <strong>Kumaran Asan</strong> as
a disciple of Narayana Guru. In <strong>1889</strong>, the
<strong>Aruvippuram Kshetra Yogam</strong> was formed, which was decided
to expand into a big organisation to help the Ezhavas progress
materially as well as spiritually.</p>
<p>Thus, the <strong>Aruvippuram Sree Narayana Guru Dharma Paripalana
Yogam</strong> (in short <strong>SNDP</strong>) was registered in
<strong>1903</strong> under the Indian Companies Act, with
<strong>Narayana Guru</strong> as its permanent chairman, and
<strong>Kumaran Asan</strong> as the general secretary. (In the
formation of SNDP, the efforts of <strong>Dr. Palpu</strong> must be
acknowledged. He had started the fight for social justice through
movements like <strong>Ezhava Memorial</strong>, <strong>Malayali
Memorial</strong>, etc.)</p>
<p><strong>Sree Narayana Guru</strong> held all religions to be the same
and condemned animal sacrifice besides speaking against divisiveness on
the basis of caste, race, or creed. On the wall of the Aruvippuram
temple he got inscribed the words, “<strong>Devoid of dividing walls of
caste or race, or hatred of rival faith, we all live here in
brotherhood.</strong>” He urged the Ezhavas to leave the toddy-tapping
profession and even to stop drinking liquor.</p>
<p>The <strong>SNDP Yogam</strong> took up several issues for the
Ezhavas, such as:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Right of admission to public schools</strong>;</li>
<li><strong>Recruitment to government services</strong>;</li>
<li><strong>Access to roads and entry to temples</strong>;</li>
<li><strong>Political representation</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The movement as a whole brought transformative structural changes
such as upward social mobility, a shift in the traditional distribution
of power, and a federation of ‘backward castes’ into a large
conglomeration.</p>
<h3 id="vokkaliga-sangha">Vokkaliga Sangha</h3>
<p>The <strong>Vokkaliga Sangha</strong> in <strong>Mysore</strong>
launched an <strong>anti-brahmin movement</strong> in
<strong>1905</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="justice-movement">Justice Movement</h3>
<p>This movement in <strong>Madras Presidency</strong> was started by
<strong>C.N. Mudaliar</strong>, <strong>T.M. Nair</strong>, and
<strong>P. Tyagaraja</strong> to secure jobs and representation for the
non-brahmins in the legislature. In <strong>1917</strong>, the
<strong>Madras Presidency Association</strong> was formed, which
demanded <strong>separate representation for the lower castes</strong>
in the legislature.</p>
<h3 id="self-respect-movement">Self-Respect Movement</h3>
<p>This movement was started by <strong>E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker</strong>,
a <strong>Balija Naidu</strong>, in the mid-1920s. The movement aimed at
nothing short of a rejection of the <strong>brahminical religion and
culture</strong>, which Naicker felt was the prime instrument of
exploitation of the lower castes. He sought to undermine the position of
brahmin priests by formalizing <strong>weddings without brahmin
priests</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="temple-entry-movement">Temple Entry Movement</h3>
<p>Significant work in this direction had already been done by reformers
and intellectuals like <strong>Sree Narayana Guru</strong> and
<strong>N. Kumaran Asan</strong>. <strong>T.K. Madhavan</strong>, a
prominent social reformer and editor of <strong>Deshabhimani</strong>,
took up the issue of temple entry with the Travancore administration,
but nothing transpired. In the meanwhile, <strong>Vaikom</strong>, in
the northern part of Travancore, became a center of agitation for temple
entry. In <strong>1924</strong>, the <strong>Vaikom Satyagraha</strong>,
led by <strong>K.P. Kesava</strong>, was launched in Kerala demanding
the throwing open of Hindu temples and roads to the untouchables. The
satyagraha was reinforced by <strong>jathas</strong> from
<strong>Punjab</strong> and <strong>Madurai</strong>.
<strong>Gandhi</strong> undertook a tour of Kerala in support of the
movement.</p>
<p>Again, in <strong>1931</strong>, when the <strong>Civil Disobedience
Movement</strong> was suspended, the <strong>temple entry
movement</strong> was organized in Kerala. Inspired by <strong>K.
Kelappan</strong>, poet <strong>Subramaniyam Tirumambu</strong> (the
‘singing sword of Kerala’) led a group of 16 volunteers to
<strong>Guruvayur</strong>. Leaders like <strong>P. Krishna
Pillai</strong> and <strong>A.K. Gopalan</strong> were among the
satyagrahis. Finally, on <strong>November 12, 1936</strong>, the
<strong>Maharaja of Travancore</strong> issued a proclamation throwing
open all government-controlled temples to all Hindus.</p>
<p>A similar step was taken by the <strong>C. Rajagopalachari
administration</strong> in <strong>Madras</strong> in
<strong>1938</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="indian-social-conference">Indian Social Conference</h3>
<p>Founded by <strong>M.G. Ranade</strong> and <strong>Raghunath
Rao</strong>, the <strong>Indian Social Conference</strong> met annually
from its first session in <strong>Madras in 1887</strong> at the same
time and venue as the <strong>Indian National Congress</strong>. It
focused attention on social issues of importance; it could be called the
social reform cell of the Indian National Congress, in fact. The
conference advocated <strong>inter-caste marriages</strong>, opposed
<strong>polygamy</strong> and <strong>kulinism</strong>. It launched the
<strong>‘Pledge Movement’</strong> to inspire people to take a pledge
against <strong>child marriage</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="wahabiwalliullah-movement">Wahabi/Walliullah Movement</h3>
<p>The teachings of <strong>Abdul Wahab</strong> of Arabia and the
preachings of <strong>Shah Walliullah</strong>
(<strong>1702–63</strong>) inspired this essentially revivalist response
to Western influences and the degeneration which had set in among Indian
Muslims, calling for a return to the true spirit of Islam. He was the
first Indian Muslim leader of the 18th century to organize Muslims
around the two-fold ideals of this movement:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Desirability of harmony among the four schools of Muslim
jurisprudence</strong>, which had divided the Indian Muslims (he sought
to integrate the best elements of the four schools).</li>
<li><strong>Recognition of the role of individual conscience in
religion</strong> where conflicting interpretations were derived from
the Quran and the Hadis.</li>
</ol>
<p>The teachings of Walliullah were further popularized by <strong>Shah
Abdul Aziz</strong> and <strong>Syed Ahmad Barelvi</strong>, who also
gave them a political perspective. Un-Islamic practices that had crept
into Muslim society were sought to be eliminated. <strong>Syed
Ahmad</strong> called for a return to pure Islam and the kind of society
that had existed in the Arabia of the Prophet’s time. India was
considered to be <strong>dar-ul-Harb</strong> (land of the kafirs), and
it needed to be converted to <strong>dar-ul-Islam</strong> (land of
Islam).</p>
<p>Initially, the movement was directed at the Sikhs in Punjab, but
after the British annexation of Punjab (<strong>1849</strong>), the
movement was directed against the British. During the <strong>1857
Revolt</strong>, the <strong>Wahabis</strong> played an important role
in spreading anti-British feelings. The <strong>Wahabi Movement</strong>
fizzled out in the face of British military might in the
<strong>1870s</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="titu-mirs-movement">Titu Mir’s Movement</h3>
<p><strong>Syed Mir Nisar Ali</strong>, popularly known as <strong>Titu
Mir</strong>, was a disciple of <strong>Syed Ahmad Barelvi</strong> (of
Rae Bareilly), an adherent of the <strong>Wahabi movement</strong>. Titu
Mir adopted <strong>Wahabism</strong> and advocated the
<strong>Sharia</strong>. He organized the <strong>Muslim peasants of
Bengal</strong> against the landlords, who were mostly Hindu, and the
<strong>British indigo planters</strong>. The movement was not as
militant as the British records made it out to be; only in the last year
of Titu’s life was there a confrontation between him and the British
police. He was killed in action in <strong>1831</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="faraizi-movement">Faraizi Movement</h3>
<p>The movement, also called the <strong>Fara’idi Movement</strong>
because of its emphasis on the <strong>Islamic pillars of
faith</strong>, was founded by <strong>Haji Shariatullah</strong> in
<strong>1819</strong>. Its scene of action was <strong>East
Bengal</strong>, and it aimed at the eradication of social innovations
or un-Islamic practices current among the Muslims of the region and
drawing their attention to their duties as Muslims. Under the leadership
of Haji’s son, <strong>Dudu Mian</strong>, the movement became
revolutionary from <strong>1840</strong> onwards. He gave the movement
an organizational system from the village to the provincial level with a
<strong>khalifa</strong> or authorized deputy at every level.</p>
<p>The Fara’idis organized a paramilitary force armed with clubs to
fight the zamindars, who were mostly Hindu, though there were some
Muslim landlords too, besides the indigo planters. <strong>Dudu
Mian</strong> asked his followers not to pay rent. The organization even
established its own law courts.</p>
<p>Dudu Mian was arrested several times, and his arrest in
<strong>1847</strong> finally weakened the movement. The movement
survived merely as a religious movement without political overtones
after the death of <strong>Dudu Mian</strong> in
<strong>1862</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="ahmadiyya-movement">Ahmadiyya Movement</h3>
<p>The <strong>Ahmadiyya</strong> forms a sect of Islam which originated
from India. It was founded by <strong>Mirza Ghulam Ahmad</strong> in
<strong>1889</strong>. It was based on <strong>liberal
principles</strong>. It described itself as the standard-bearer of
<strong>Mohammedan Renaissance</strong>, and based itself, like the
<strong>Brahmo Samaj</strong>, on the principles of universal religion
of all humanity, opposing <strong>jihad</strong> (sacred war against
non-Muslims). The movement spread <strong>Western liberal
education</strong> among the Indian Muslims.</p>
<p>The <strong>Ahmadiyya</strong> community is the only Islamic sect to
believe that the <strong>Messiah had come</strong> in the person of
Mirza Ghulam Ahmad to end religious wars and bloodshed and to reinstate
<strong>morality, peace, and justice</strong>. They believed in
separating the <strong>mosque from the State</strong> as well as in
<strong>human rights and tolerance</strong>. However, the Ahmadiyya
Movement, like <strong>Baha’ism</strong> which flourished in the West
Asian countries, suffered from <strong>mysticism</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="sir-syed-ahmed-khan-and-the-aligarh-movement">Sir Syed Ahmed
Khan and the Aligarh Movement</h3>
<p>The <strong>British view</strong> on the <strong>revolt of
1857</strong> held the <strong>Muslims</strong> to be the main
conspirators. This view was further strengthened by the activities of
the <strong>Wahabis</strong>. But later, an opinion gained currency
among the rulers that the Muslims could be used as allies against a
rising tide of nationalist political activity represented, among others,
by the foundation of the <strong>Indian National Congress</strong>. This
was to be achieved through offers of thoughtful concessions to the
Muslims. A section of Muslims led by <strong>Syed Ahmed Khan</strong>
(<strong>1817–98</strong>) was ready to allow the official patronage to
stimulate a process of growth among Indian Muslims through better
education and employment opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Syed Ahmed Khan</strong>, born in a respectable Muslim
family, was a loyalist member of the judicial service of the British
government. After retirement in <strong>1876</strong>, he became a
member of the <strong>Imperial Legislative Council</strong> in
<strong>1878</strong>. His loyalty earned him a knighthood in
<strong>1888</strong>. He wanted to reconcile <strong>Western scientific
education</strong> with the teachings of the <strong>Quran</strong>,
which were to be interpreted in the light of contemporary rationalism
and science even though he also held the Quran to be the ultimate
authority. He said that religion should be adaptable with time or else
it would become fossilized, and that religious tenets were not
immutable. He advocated a critical approach and <strong>freedom of
thought</strong> and not complete dependence on tradition or custom.</p>
<p>He was also a zealous educationist—as an official, he opened schools
in towns, got books translated into Urdu, and started the
<strong>Mohammedan Anglo-Oriental College</strong> (later, the
<strong>Aligarh Muslim University</strong>) at <strong>Aligarh</strong>
in <strong>1875</strong>. He also struggled to bring about an
improvement in the position of women through better education and by
opposing <strong>purdah</strong> and <strong>polygamy</strong>,
advocating easy divorce, and condemning the system of
<strong>piri</strong> and <strong>muridi</strong>. He believed in the
fundamental underlying unity of religions or ‘practical morality’. He
also preached the basic commonality of Hindu and Muslim interests.</p>
<p><strong>Syed Ahmed Khan</strong> argued that Muslims should first
concentrate on <strong>education and jobs</strong> and try to catch up
with their Hindu counterparts who had gained the advantage of an early
start. Active participation in politics at that point, he felt, would
invite hostility of the government towards the Muslim masses. Therefore,
he opposed political activity by the Muslims. Unfortunately, in his
enthusiasm to promote the educational and employment interests of the
Muslims, he allowed himself to be used by the colonial government in its
obnoxious policy of <strong>divide and rule</strong> and, in later
years, started propagating divergence of interests of Hindus and
Muslims.</p>
<p>Syed’s progressive social ideas were propagated through his magazine
<strong>Tahdhib-ul-Akhlaq</strong> (Improvement of Manners and
Morals).</p>
<p>The <strong>Aligarh Movement</strong> emerged as a liberal, modern
trend among the Muslim intelligentsia based in <strong>Mohammedan
Anglo-Oriental College, Aligarh</strong>. It aimed at spreading:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Modern education</strong> among Indian Muslims without
weakening their allegiance to Islam.</li>
<li><strong>Social reforms</strong> among Muslims relating to purdah,
polygamy, widow remarriage, women’s education, slavery, divorce,
etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>The ideology of the followers of the movement was based on a
<strong>liberal interpretation of the Quran</strong> and they sought to
harmonize Islam with modern liberal culture. They wanted to impart a
distinct socio-cultural identity to Muslims on modern lines. Soon,
Aligarh became the center of religious and cultural revival of the
Muslim community.</p>
<h3 id="the-deoband-school-darul-uloom">The Deoband School (Darul
Uloom)</h3>
<p>The <strong>Deoband Movement</strong> was organized by the orthodox
section among the <strong>Muslim ulema</strong> as a revivalist movement
with the twin objectives of propagating pure teachings of the
<strong>Quran and Hadis</strong> among Muslims and keeping alive the
spirit of <strong>jihad</strong> against the foreign rulers. The Deoband
Movement was begun at the <strong>Darul Uloom</strong> (or Islamic
academic centre), <strong>Deoband</strong>, in <strong>Saharanpur
district</strong> (United Provinces) in <strong>1866</strong> by
<strong>Muhammad Qasim Nanautavi</strong> (<strong>1832–80</strong>) and
<strong>Rashid Ahmad Gangohi</strong> (<strong>1828–1905</strong>) to
train religious leaders for the Muslim community.</p>
<p>In contrast to the <strong>Aligarh Movement</strong>, which aimed at
the welfare of Muslims through <strong>Western education</strong> and
support of the British government, the aim of the Deoband Movement was
the <strong>moral and religious regeneration</strong> of the Muslim
community. The instruction imparted at Deoband was in original Islamic
religion.</p>
<p>On the political front, the Deoband school welcomed the formation of
the <strong>Indian National Congress</strong> and in
<strong>1888</strong> issued a <strong>fatwa</strong> (religious decree)
against <strong>Syed Ahmed Khan’s</strong> organizations, the
<strong>United Patriotic Association</strong> and the <strong>Mohammaden
Anglo-Oriental Association</strong>. Some critics attribute Deoband’s
support to the nationalists more to its determined opposition to Syed
Ahmed Khan than to any positive political philosophy.</p>
<p><strong>Mahmud-ul-Hasan</strong>, the new Deoband leader, gave a
political and intellectual content to the religious ideas of the school.
He worked out a synthesis of Islamic principles and nationalist
aspirations. The <strong>Jamiat-ul-Ulema</strong> gave a concrete shape
to Hasan’s ideas of protection of the religious and political rights of
the Muslims in the overall context of Indian unity and national
objectives.</p>
<p><strong>Shibli Numani</strong>, a supporter of the Deoband school,
favored the inclusion of the <strong>English language</strong> and
<strong>European sciences</strong> in the system of education. He
founded the <strong>Nadwatal Ulama</strong> and <strong>Darul
Uloom</strong> in <strong>Lucknow</strong> in <strong>1894–96</strong>.
He believed in the idealism of the Congress and cooperation between the
<strong>Muslims and the Hindus</strong> of India to create a state in
which both could live amicably.</p>
<h3 id="parsi-reform-movements">Parsi Reform Movements</h3>
<p>The <strong>Rahnumai Mazdayasnan Sabha</strong> (Religious Reform
Association) was founded in <strong>1851</strong> by a group of
<strong>English-educated Parsis</strong> for the “regeneration of the
social conditions of the Parsis and the restoration of the Zoroastrian
religion to its pristine purity.” The movement had <strong>Naoroji
Furdonji</strong>, <strong>Dadabhai Naoroji</strong>, <strong>K.R.
Cama</strong>, and <strong>S.S. Bengalee</strong> as its leaders. The
message of reform was spread by the newspaper <strong>Rast
Goftar</strong> (Truth-Teller).</p>
<p><strong>Parsi religious rituals and practices</strong> were reformed
and the <strong>Parsi creed</strong> redefined. In the social sphere,
attempts were made to uplift the status of <strong>Parsi women</strong>
through the removal of the <strong>purdah system</strong>, raising the
<strong>age of marriage</strong>, and promoting
<strong>education</strong>. Gradually, the Parsis emerged as the most
<strong>westernised section</strong> of Indian society.</p>
<h3 id="sikh-reform-movements">Sikh Reform Movements</h3>
<p>The <strong>Sikh community</strong> could not remain untouched by the
rising tide of <strong>rationalist and progressive ideas</strong> of the
19th century. The <strong>Singh Sabha Movement</strong> was founded at
<strong>Amritsar in 1873</strong> with a two-fold objective:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>To make available <strong>modern Western education</strong> to the
Sikhs.</li>
<li>To counter the proselytizing activities of <strong>Christian
missionaries</strong> as well as the <strong>Brahmo Samajists</strong>,
<strong>Arya Samajists</strong>, and <strong>Muslim
maulvis</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the first objective, a network of <strong>Khalsa schools</strong>
was established by the Sabha throughout Punjab. In the second direction,
everything that went against the <strong>Gurus’ teachings</strong> was
rejected, and rites and customs considered to be consistent with
<strong>Sikh doctrine</strong> were sought to be established.</p>
<p>The <strong>Akali Movement</strong> (also known as <strong>Gurudwara
Reform Movement</strong>) was an offshoot of the Singh Sabha Movement.
It aimed at liberating the Sikh <strong>gurudwaras</strong> from the
control of corrupt <strong>Udasi mahants</strong> (the post having
become hereditary). These mahants were a loyalist and reactionary lot,
enjoying government patronage. The government tried its repressive
policies against the non-violent non-cooperation
<strong>satyagraha</strong> launched by the Akalis in
<strong>1921</strong>, but had to bow before popular demands; it passed
the <strong>Sikh Gurudwaras Act</strong> in <strong>1922</strong>
(amended in <strong>1925</strong>) which gave the control of gurudwaras
to the Sikh masses to be administered through the <strong>Shiromani
Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee (SGPC)</strong> as the apex body.</p>
<p>The <strong>Akali Movement</strong> was a regional movement but not a
communal one. The <strong>Akali leaders</strong> played a notable role
in the national liberation struggle though some dissenting voices were
heard occasionally.</p>
<h3 id="the-theosophical-movement">The Theosophical Movement</h3>
<p>A group of westerners led by <strong>Madame H.P. Blavatsky</strong>
(<strong>1831–91</strong>) and <strong>Colonel M.S. Olcott</strong>, who
were inspired by Indian thought and culture, founded the
<strong>Theosophical Society</strong> in <strong>New York City</strong>,
United States in <strong>1875</strong>. In <strong>1882</strong>, they
shifted their headquarters to <strong>Adyar</strong>, on the outskirts
of <strong>Madras</strong> (now Chennai) in India. The society believed
that a special relationship could be established between a person’s soul
and God by contemplation, prayer, revelation, etc. It accepted the Hindu
beliefs in <strong>reincarnation</strong> and <strong>karma</strong>,
and drew inspiration from the philosophy of the
<strong>Upanishads</strong> and <strong>Samkhya</strong>,
<strong>Yoga</strong>, and <strong>Vedanta</strong> schools of thought.
It aimed to work for the <strong>universal brotherhood of
humanity</strong> without distinction of race, creed, sex, caste, or
color. The society also sought to investigate the <strong>unexplained
laws of nature</strong> and the <strong>powers latent in
man</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Theosophical Movement</strong> came to be allied with the
<strong>Hindu renaissance</strong>. (At one time it allied with the
<strong>Arya Samaj</strong> too.) It opposed <strong>child
marriage</strong> and advocated the <strong>abolition of caste
discrimination</strong>, uplift of and improvement in the condition of
widows.</p>
<p>In India, the movement became somewhat popular with the election of
<strong>Annie Besant</strong> (<strong>1847–1933</strong>) as its
president after the death of Olcott in <strong>1907</strong>.
<strong>Annie Besant</strong> had come to India in
<strong>1893</strong>. She laid the foundation of the <strong>Central
Hindu College</strong> in <strong>Benaras</strong> in
<strong>1898</strong> where both Hindu religion and Western scientific
subjects were taught. The college became the nucleus for the formation
of <strong>Benaras Hindu University</strong> in <strong>1916</strong>.
Annie Besant also did much for the cause of the <strong>education of
women</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Theosophical Society</strong> provided a common
denominator for the various sects and fulfilled the urge of educated
Hindus. However, to an average Indian, the Theosophist philosophy seemed
to be vague and lacking a positive program; to that extent, its impact
was limited to a small segment of the westernized class. As religious
revivalists, the Theosophists did not attain much success, but as a
movement of westerners glorifying Indian religious and philosophical
traditions, it gave much-needed <strong>self-respect to the
Indians</strong> fighting British colonial rule. Viewed from another
angle, the Theosophists also had the effect of giving a <strong>false
sense of pride</strong> to the Indians in their outdated and sometimes
backward-looking traditions and philosophy.</p>
<h2 id="significance-of-reform-movements">Significance of Reform
Movements</h2>
<h3 id="positive-aspects">Positive Aspects</h3>
<p>The <strong>orthodox sections of society</strong> could not accept
the scientific ideological onslaught of the socio-religious rebels. As a
result, the reformers were subjected to abuse, persecution, issuing of
<strong>fatwas</strong>, and even <strong>assassination
attempts</strong> by the reactionaries. However, in spite of opposition,
these movements managed to contribute towards the <strong>liberation of
the individual</strong> from the conformity born out of fear and from
uncritical submission to exploitation by the priests and other
classes.</p>
<p>The translation of <strong>religious texts into vernacular
languages</strong>, emphasis on an individual’s right to
<strong>interpret the scriptures</strong>, and <strong>simplification of
rituals</strong> made worship a more personal experience. The movements
emphasized the <strong>human intellect’s capacity to think and
reason</strong>. By weeding out corrupt elements, religious beliefs and
practices, the reformers enabled their followers to meet the official
taunt that their religions and society were decadent and inferior.</p>
<p>The <strong>reform movements</strong> gave the rising middle classes
the much-needed <strong>cultural roots</strong> to cling to and served
the purpose of reducing the sense of <strong>humiliation</strong> which
the conquest by a foreign power had produced. A realization of the
special needs of modern times, especially in terms of <strong>scientific
knowledge</strong>, and thus promoting a modern, this-worldly,
<strong>secular</strong>, and <strong>rational outlook</strong> was a
major contribution of these reform movements.</p>
<p>Socially, this attitude reflected in a basic change in the notions of
<strong>‘pollution and purity’</strong>. Although traditional values and
customs were a prominent target of attack from the reformers, yet the
reformers aimed at <strong>modernization</strong> rather than outright
<strong>westernization</strong> based on blind imitation of alien
Western cultural values. In fact, the reform movements sought to create
a favorable social climate for modernization. To that extent, these
movements ended India’s <strong>cultural and intellectual
isolation</strong> from the rest of the world. The reformers argued that
modern ideas and culture could be best imbibed by integrating them into
Indian cultural streams.</p>
<p>The underlying concern of these reformist efforts was the
<strong>revival of the native cultural personality</strong> which had
got distorted by various factors over the years. This <strong>cultural
ideological struggle</strong> was to prove to be an important instrument
in the evolution of <strong>national consciousness</strong> and a part
of Indian national resolve to resist colonial cultural and ideological
hegemony. However, not all these progressive, nationalist tendencies
were able to outgrow the sectarian and obscurantist outlook. This was
possibly due to the <strong>divergent duality of cultural and political
struggles</strong>, resulting in cultural backwardness despite political
advancement. ### Negative Aspects One of the major limitations of the
<strong>religious reform movements</strong> was that they had a narrow
social base, namely the <strong>educated and urban middle
classes</strong>, while the needs of the vast masses of
<strong>peasantry and the urban poor</strong> were ignored. The tendency
of reformers to appeal to the greatness of the past and to rely on
<strong>scriptural authority</strong> encouraged mysticism in new garbs
and fostered pseudo-scientific thinking while exercising a check on the
full acceptance of the need for a modern scientific outlook. But, above
all, these tendencies contributed, at least to some extent, to
compartmentalizing <strong>Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs</strong>, and
<strong>Parsis</strong>, as also alienating <strong>high-caste
Hindus</strong> from <strong>low-caste Hindus</strong>.</p>
<p>The emphasis on <strong>religious and philosophical aspects</strong>
of the cultural heritage got somewhat magnified by an insufficient
emphasis on other aspects of culture—<strong>art, architecture,
literature, music, science, and technology</strong>. To make matters
worse, the Hindu reformers confined their praise of the Indian past to
its <strong>ancient period</strong> and looked upon the <strong>medieval
period</strong> of Indian history essentially as an era of decadence.
This tended to create a notion of <strong>two separate peoples</strong>,
on the one hand; on the other, an uncritical praise of the past was not
acceptable to the low-caste sections of society which had suffered under
religiously sanctioned exploitation during the ancient period. Moreover,
the past itself tended to be placed into compartments on a partisan
basis. Many in the <strong>Muslim middle classes</strong> went to the
extent of turning to the history of <strong>West Asia</strong> for their
traditions and moments of pride.</p>
<p>The process of evolution of a <strong>composite culture</strong>
which was evident throughout Indian history showed signs of being
arrested with the rise of another form of consciousness—<strong>communal
consciousness</strong>—along with <strong>national
consciousness</strong> among the middle classes. Many other factors were
certainly responsible for the birth of <strong>communalism</strong> in
modern times, but, undoubtedly, the nature of religious reform movements
also contributed to it.</p>
<p>On the whole, however, whatever the net outcome of these reform
movements, it was out of this struggle that a <strong>new society
evolved in India</strong>.</p>
