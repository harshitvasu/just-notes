<div class="crossnote markdown-preview"><h3><strong>Supreme Court</strong></h3><p>Unlike the <strong>American Constitution</strong>, the <strong>Indian Constitution</strong> has established an integrated judicial system with the <strong>Supreme Court</strong> at the top and the <strong>high courts</strong> below it. Under a high court (and below the state level), there is a hierarchy of <strong>subordinate courts</strong>, that is, <strong>district courts</strong> and other <strong>lower courts</strong>. This single system of courts, adopted from the <strong>Government of India Act of 1935</strong>, enforces both <strong>Central laws</strong> as well as the <strong>state laws</strong>. In <strong>USA</strong>, on the other hand, the <strong>federal laws</strong> are enforced by the <strong>federal judiciary</strong> and the <strong>state laws</strong> are enforced by the <strong>state judiciary</strong>. There is thus a <strong>double system of courts</strong> in USA–one for the centre and the other for the states. To sum up, <strong>India</strong>, although a federal country like the USA, has a <strong>unified judiciary</strong> and one system of fundamental law and justice.</p><p>The <strong>Supreme Court of India</strong> was inaugurated on <strong>January 28, 1950</strong>. It succeeded the <strong>Federal Court of India</strong>, established under the <strong>Government of India Act of 1935</strong>. However, the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is greater than that of its predecessor. This is because, the Supreme Court has replaced the <strong>British Privy Council</strong> as the highest court of appeal.</p><p><strong>Articles 124 to 147</strong> in <strong>Part V</strong> of the <strong>Constitution</strong> deal with the organisation, independence, jurisdiction, powers, procedures and so on of the Supreme Court. The <strong>Parliament</strong> is also authorised to regulate them.</p><h3><strong>COMPOSITION AND APPOINTMENT</strong></h3><p>At present, the <strong>Supreme Court</strong> consists of <strong>thirty-four judges</strong> (one chief justice and thirty-three other judges). In <strong>2019</strong>, the centre notified an increase in the number of Supreme Court judges from thirty-one to thirty-four, including the <strong>Chief Justice of India</strong>. This followed the enactment of the <strong>Supreme Court (Number of Judges) Amendment Act, 2019</strong>. Originally, the strength of the Supreme Court was fixed at <strong>eight</strong> (one chief justice and seven other judges). The <strong>Parliament</strong> has increased this number of other judges progressively to <strong>ten in 1956</strong>, to <strong>thirteen in 1960</strong>, to <strong>seventeen in 1977</strong>, to <strong>twenty-five in 1986</strong>, to <strong>thirty in 2008</strong>, and to <strong>thirty-three in 2019</strong>.</p><h3>Appointment of Judges</h3><p>The judges of the Supreme Court are appointed by the <strong>president</strong>. The chief justice is appointed by the president after consultation with such judges of the Supreme Court and high courts as he deems necessary. The other judges are appointed by the president after consultation with the chief justice and such other judges of the Supreme Court and the high courts as he deems necessary. The consultation with the chief justice is obligatory in the case of appointment of a judge other than Chief Justice.</p><h3>Controversy over Consultation</h3><p>The Supreme Court has given different interpretations of the word ‘<strong>consultation</strong>’ in the above provision. In the <strong>First Judges case (1982)</strong>, the Court held that consultation does not mean concurrence and it only implies exchange of views. But, in the <strong>Second Judges case (1993)</strong>, the Court reversed its earlier ruling and changed the meaning of the word consultation to concurrence. Hence, it ruled that the advice tendered by the <strong>Chief Justice of India</strong> is binding on the President in the matters of appointment of the judges of the Supreme Court. But, the Chief Justice would tender his advice on the matter after consulting two of his seniormost colleagues. Similarly, in the <strong>Third Judges case (1998)</strong>, the Court opined that the consultation process to be adopted by the Chief Justice of India requires ‘consultation of plurality judges’. The sole opinion of the Chief Justice of India does not constitute the consultation process. He should consult a collegium of four seniormost judges of the Supreme Court and even if two judges give an adverse opinion, he should not send the recommendation to the government. The court held that the recommendation made by the Chief Justice of India without complying with the norms and requirements of the consultation process are not binding on the government.</p><p>The <strong>99th Constitutional Amendment Act of 2014</strong> and the <strong>National Judicial Appointments Commission Act of 2014</strong> have replaced the collegium system of appointing judges to the Supreme Court and High Courts with a new body called the <strong>National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC)</strong>. However, in <strong>2015</strong>, the Supreme Court has declared both the <strong>99th Constitutional Amendment</strong> as well as the <strong>NJAC Act</strong> as unconstitutional and void. Consequently, the earlier collegium system became operative again. This verdict was delivered by the Supreme Court in the <strong>Fourth Judges case (2015)</strong>. The court opined that the new system (i.e., NJAC) would affect the independence of the judiciary.</p><h3>Appointment of Chief Justice</h3><p>From <strong>1950 to 1973</strong>, the practice has been to appoint the seniormost judge of the Supreme Court as the Chief Justice of India. This established convention was violated in <strong>1973</strong> when <strong>A.N. Ray</strong> was appointed as the Chief Justice of India by superseding three senior judges. Again in <strong>1977</strong>, <strong>M.U. Beg</strong> was appointed as the Chief Justice of India by superseding the then senior-most judge. This discretion of the government was curtailed by the Supreme Court in the <strong>Second Judges Case (1993)</strong>, in which the Supreme Court ruled that the seniormost judge of the Supreme Court should alone be appointed to the office of the Chief Justice of India.</p><h3><strong>QUALIFICATIONS, OATH AND SALARIES</strong></h3><h3>Qualifications of Judges</h3><p>A person to be appointed as a judge of the <strong>Supreme Court</strong> should have the following qualifications:</p><ol><li>He should be a <strong>citizen of India</strong>.</li><li>(a) He should have been a <strong>judge of a High Court</strong> (or high courts in succession) for <strong>five years</strong>; or (b) He should have been an <strong>advocate of a High Court</strong> (or High Courts in succession) for <strong>ten years</strong>; or (c) He should be a <strong>distinguished jurist</strong> in the opinion of the president.</li></ol><p>From the above, it is clear that the <strong>Constitution</strong> has not prescribed a minimum age for appointment as a judge of the Supreme Court.</p><h3>Oath or Affirmation</h3><p>A person appointed as a judge of the Supreme Court, before entering upon his Office, has to make and subscribe an <strong>oath or affirmation</strong> before the <strong>President</strong>, or some person appointed by him for this purpose. In his oath, a judge of the Supreme Court swears:</p><ol><li>to bear true faith and allegiance to the <strong>Constitution of India</strong>;</li><li>to uphold the <strong>sovereignty and integrity of India</strong>;</li><li>to duly and faithfully and to the best of his ability, knowledge and judgement perform the duties of the Office without <strong>fear or favour, affection or ill-will</strong>; and</li><li>to uphold the <strong>Constitution</strong> and the <strong>laws</strong>.</li></ol><h3>Salaries and Allowances</h3><p>The <strong>salaries, allowances, privileges, leave and pension</strong> of the judges of the Supreme Court are determined from time to time by the <strong>Parliament</strong>. They cannot be varied to their disadvantage after their appointment except during a <strong>financial emergency</strong>. In <strong>2018</strong>, the salary of the chief justice was increased from ₹1 lakh to ₹2.80 lakh per month and that of a judge from ₹90,000 to ₹2.50 lakh per month. They are also paid <strong>sumptuary allowance</strong> and provided with <strong>free accommodation</strong> and other facilities like medical, car, telephone, etc.</p><p>The retired chief justice and judges are entitled to <strong>50 per cent of their last drawn salary</strong> as monthly pension.</p><h3><strong>TENURE AND REMOVAL</strong></h3><h3>Tenure of Judges</h3><p>The <strong>Constitution</strong> has not fixed the tenure of a judge of the <strong>Supreme Court</strong>. However, it makes the following three provisions in this regard:</p><ol><li>He holds office until he attains the age of <strong>65 years</strong>. Any question regarding his age is to be determined by such authority and in such manner as provided by <strong>Parliament</strong>.</li><li>He can resign his office by writing to the <strong>president</strong>.</li><li>He can be removed from his office by the president on the recommendation of the <strong>Parliament</strong>.</li></ol><h3>Removal of Judges</h3><p>A judge of the Supreme Court can be removed from his office by an order of the <strong>president</strong>. The president can issue the removal order only after an address by Parliament has been presented to him in the same session for such removal. The address must be supported by a <strong>special majority</strong> of each House of Parliament (i.e., a majority of the total membership of that House and a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members of that House present and voting). The grounds of removal are two–<strong>proved misbehaviour</strong> or <strong>incapacity</strong>.</p><p>The <strong>Judges Enquiry Act (1968)</strong> regulates the procedure relating to the removal of a judge of the Supreme Court by the process of impeachment:</p><ol><li>A removal motion signed by <strong>100 members</strong> (in the case of Lok Sabha) or <strong>50 members</strong> (in the case of Rajya Sabha) is to be given to the <strong>Speaker/Chairman</strong>.</li><li>The Speaker/Chairman may admit the motion or refuse to admit it.</li><li>If it is admitted, then the Speaker/Chairman is to constitute a <strong>three-member committee</strong> to investigate the charges.</li><li>The committee should consist of (a) the chief justice or a judge of the Supreme Court, (b) a chief justice of a high court, and (c) a distinguished jurist.</li><li>If the committee finds the judge to be guilty of misbehaviour or suffering from an incapacity, the House can take up the consideration of the motion.</li><li>After the motion is passed by each House of Parliament by special majority, an address is presented to the president for removal of the judge.</li><li>Finally, the president passes an order removing the judge.</li></ol><p>It is interesting to know that no judge of the Supreme Court has been impeached so far. The first case of impeachment is that of <strong>Justice V. Ramaswami</strong> of the Supreme Court (<strong>1991–1993</strong>). Though the enquiry Committee found him guilty of misbehaviour, he could not be removed as the impeachment motion was defeated in the Lok Sabha. The <strong>Congress Party</strong> abstained from voting.</p><h3><strong>INDEPENDENCE OF SUPREME COURT</strong></h3><p>The <strong>Supreme Court</strong> has been assigned a very significant role in the Indian democratic political system. It is a <strong>federal court</strong>, the <strong>highest court of appeal</strong>, the guarantor of the <strong>fundamental rights</strong> of the citizens, and guardian of the <strong>Constitution</strong>. Therefore, its independence becomes very essential for the effective discharge of the duties assigned to it. It should be free from the encroachments, pressures, and interferences of the <strong>executive</strong> (council of ministers) and the <strong>Legislature</strong> (Parliament). It should be allowed to do justice without fear or favour.</p><p>The <strong>Constitution</strong> has made the following provisions to safeguard and ensure the independent and impartial functioning of the Supreme Court:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Mode of Appointment</strong>
The judges of the Supreme Court are appointed by the <strong>President</strong> (which means the cabinet) in consultation with the members of the judiciary itself (i.e., judges of the Supreme Court and the high courts). This provision curtails the absolute discretion of the executive as well as ensures that the judicial appointments are not based on any political or practical considerations.</p></li><li><p><strong>Security of Tenure</strong>
The judges of the Supreme Court are provided with the <strong>Security of Tenure</strong>. They can be removed from office by the President only in the manner and on the grounds mentioned in the Constitution. This means that they do not hold their office during the pleasure of the President, though they are appointed by him. This is obvious from the fact that no judge of the Supreme Court has been removed (or impeached) so far.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fixed Service Conditions</strong>
The <strong>salaries, allowances, privileges, leave, and pension</strong> of the judges of the Supreme Court are determined from time to time by the <strong>Parliament</strong>. They cannot be changed to their disadvantage after their appointment except during a financial emergency. Thus, the conditions of service of the judges of the Supreme Court remain the same during their term of office.</p></li><li><p><strong>Expenses Charged on Consolidated Fund</strong>
The <strong>salaries, allowances, and pensions</strong> of the judges and the staff as well as all the administrative expenses of the Supreme Court are charged on the <strong>Consolidated Fund of India</strong>. Thus, they are non-votable by the Parliament (though they can be discussed by it).</p></li><li><p><strong>Conduct of Judges cannot be Discussed</strong>
The Constitution prohibits any discussion in Parliament or in a State Legislature with respect to the conduct of the judges of the Supreme Court in the discharge of their duties, except when an <strong>impeachment motion</strong> is under consideration of the Parliament.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ban on Practice after Retirement</strong>
The retired judges of the Supreme Court are prohibited from <strong>pleading or acting in any Court</strong> or before any authority within the territory of India. This ensures that they do not favour anyone in the hope of future favour.</p></li><li><p><strong>Power to Punish for its Contempt</strong>
The Supreme Court can punish any person for its <strong>contempt</strong>. Thus, its actions and decisions cannot be criticised and opposed by anybody. This power is vested in the Supreme Court to maintain its authority, dignity, and honour.</p></li><li><p><strong>Freedom to Appoint its Staff</strong>
The <strong>Chief Justice of India</strong> can appoint officers and servants of the Supreme Court without any interference from the executive. He can also prescribe their conditions of service.</p></li><li><p><strong>Its Jurisdiction cannot be Curtailed</strong>
The Parliament is not authorised to curtail the <strong>jurisdiction and powers</strong> of the Supreme Court. The Constitution has guaranteed to the Supreme Court, jurisdiction of various kinds. However, the Parliament can extend the same.</p></li><li><p><strong>Separation from Executive</strong>
The Constitution directs the State to take steps to separate the <strong>Judiciary from the Executive</strong> in the public services. This means that the executive authorities should not possess the judicial powers. Consequently, upon its implementation, the role of executive authorities in judicial administration came to an end.</p></li></ol><h3><strong>JURISDICTION AND POWERS OF SUPREME COURT</strong></h3><p>The <strong>Constitution</strong> has conferred a very extensive jurisdiction and vast powers on the <strong>Supreme Court</strong>. It is not only a <strong>Federal Court</strong> like the <strong>American Supreme Court</strong> but also a <strong>final court of appeal</strong> like the <strong>British House of Lords</strong> (the Upper House of the British Parliament). It is also the final interpreter and guardian of the <strong>Constitution</strong> and guarantor of the <strong>fundamental rights</strong> of the citizens. Further, it has <strong>advisory and supervisory powers</strong>. Therefore, <strong>Alladi Krishnaswamy Ayyar</strong>, a member of the Drafting Committee of the Constitution, rightly remarked:</p><blockquote><p>“The Supreme Court of India has more powers than any other Supreme Court in any part of the world.”</p></blockquote><p>The jurisdiction and powers of the Supreme Court can be classified into the following:</p><ol><li><strong>Original Jurisdiction</strong></li><li><strong>Writ Jurisdiction</strong></li><li><strong>Appellate Jurisdiction</strong></li><li><strong>Advisory Jurisdiction</strong></li><li><strong>A Court of Record</strong></li><li><strong>Power of Judicial Review</strong></li><li><strong>Constitutional Interpretation</strong></li><li><strong>Other Powers</strong></li></ol><h3>1. Original Jurisdiction</h3><p>As a <strong>federal court</strong>, the <strong>Supreme Court</strong> decides disputes between different units of the <strong>Indian Federation</strong>. More elaborately, any dispute:
(a) <strong>Between the Centre and one or more states</strong>; or
(b) <strong>Between the Centre and any state or states on one side and one or more other states on the other side</strong>; or
(c) <strong>Between two or more states</strong>.</p><p>In the above federal disputes, the Supreme Court has <strong>exclusive original jurisdiction</strong>. <strong>Exclusive</strong> means no other court can decide such disputes and <strong>original</strong> means the power to hear such disputes in the first instance, not by way of appeal.</p><p>With regard to the exclusive original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, two points should be noted. One, the dispute must involve a question (whether of law or fact) on which the existence or extent of a <strong>legal right</strong> depends. Thus, the questions of <strong>political nature</strong> are excluded from it. Two, any suit brought before the Supreme Court by a <strong>private citizen</strong> against the Centre or a state cannot be entertained under this.</p><p>Further, this jurisdiction of the Supreme Court does not extend to the following:
(a) A dispute arising out of any <strong>pre-Constitution treaty, agreement, covenant, engagement, sanad, or other similar instrument</strong>.
(b) A dispute arising out of any treaty, agreement, etc., which specifically provides that the said jurisdiction does not extend to such a dispute.
(c) <strong>Inter-state water disputes</strong>.
(d) Matters referred to the <strong>Finance Commission</strong>.
(e) Adjustment of certain expenses and pensions between the Centre and the states.
(f) Ordinary disputes of <strong>commercial nature</strong> between the Centre and the states.
(g) Recovery of <strong>damages</strong> by a state against the Centre.</p><p>In <strong>1961</strong>, the first suit, under the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, was brought by <strong>West Bengal</strong> against the Centre. The State Government challenged the constitutional validity of the <strong>Coal Bearing Areas (Acquisition and Development) Act, 1957</strong>, passed by the Parliament. However, the Supreme Court dismissed the suit by upholding the validity of the Act.</p><h3>2. Writ Jurisdiction</h3><p>The <strong>Constitution</strong> has constituted the <strong>Supreme Court</strong> as the guarantor and defender of the <strong>fundamental rights</strong> of the citizens. The Supreme Court is empowered to issue writs including <strong>habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto,</strong> and <strong>certiorari</strong> for the enforcement of the fundamental rights of an aggrieved citizen. In this regard, the Supreme Court has <strong>original jurisdiction</strong> in the sense that an aggrieved citizen can directly go to the Supreme Court, not necessarily by way of appeal. However, the writ jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is not exclusive. The <strong>high courts</strong> are also empowered to issue writs for the enforcement of the Fundamental Rights. This means that when the Fundamental Rights of a citizen are violated, the aggrieved party has the option of moving either the high court or the Supreme Court directly.</p><p>Therefore, the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court with regard to federal disputes is different from its original jurisdiction with regard to disputes relating to fundamental rights. In the first case, it is <strong>exclusive</strong>, and in the second case, it is <strong>concurrent with high courts jurisdiction</strong>. Moreover, the parties involved in the first case are units of the federation (<strong>Centre and states</strong>) while the dispute in the second case is between a <strong>citizen and the Government</strong> (Central or state).</p><p>There is also a difference between the writ jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and that of the high court. The Supreme Court can issue writs only for the enforcement of the <strong>Fundamental Rights</strong> and not for other purposes. The high court, on the other hand, can issue writs not only for the enforcement of the fundamental rights but also for <strong>other purposes</strong>. It means that the writ jurisdiction of the high court is wider than that of the Supreme Court. But, the <strong>Parliament</strong> can confer on the Supreme Court the power to issue writs for other purposes also.</p><h3>3. Appellate Jurisdiction</h3><p>As mentioned earlier, the <strong>Supreme Court</strong> has not only succeeded the <strong>Federal Court of India</strong> but also replaced the <strong>British Privy Council</strong> as the highest court of appeal. The Supreme Court is primarily a <strong>court of appeal</strong> and hears appeals against the judgments of the lower courts. It enjoys a wide appellate jurisdiction which can be classified under four heads:
(a) <strong>Appeals in constitutional matters</strong>
(b) <strong>Appeals in civil matters</strong>
(c) <strong>Appeals in criminal matters</strong>
(d) <strong>Appeals by special leave</strong></p><h3>(a) Constitutional Matters</h3><p>In constitutional cases, an appeal can be made to the <strong>Supreme Court</strong> against the judgment of a <strong>high court</strong> if the high court certifies that the case involves a <strong>substantial question of law</strong> that requires the interpretation of the <strong>Constitution</strong>. Based on the certificate, the party in the case can appeal to the Supreme Court on the ground that the question has been wrongly decided.</p><h3>(b) Civil Matters</h3><p>In civil cases, an appeal lies to the Supreme Court from any judgment of a high court if the high court certifies:
(i) that the case involves a <strong>substantial question of law of general importance</strong>; and
(ii) that the question needs to be decided by the Supreme Court.</p><p>Originally, only those civil cases that involved a sum of ₹20,000 could be appealed before the Supreme Court. But this monetary limit was removed by the <strong>30th Constitutional Amendment Act of 1972</strong>.</p><h3>(c) Criminal Matters</h3><p>The Supreme Court hears appeals against the judgment in a criminal proceeding of a high court if the high court:
(i) has on appeal reversed an order of <strong>acquittal</strong> of an accused person and sentenced him to <strong>death</strong>; or
(ii) has taken before itself any case from any <strong>subordinate court</strong> and convicted the accused person and sentenced him to death; or
(iii) certifies that the case is a <strong>fit one for appeal</strong> to the Supreme Court.</p><p>In the first two cases, an appeal lies to the Supreme Court as a <strong>matter of right</strong> (i.e., without any certificate of the high court). But if the high court has reversed the order of conviction and has ordered the acquittal of the accused, there is no right to appeal to the Supreme Court.</p><p>In 1970, the Parliament had enlarged the <strong>Criminal Appellate Jurisdiction</strong> of the Supreme Court. Accordingly, an appeal lies to the Supreme Court from the judgment of a high court if the high court:
(i) has on appeal, reversed an order of acquittal of an accused person and sentenced him to imprisonment for <strong>life or for ten years</strong>; or
(ii) has taken before itself any case from any subordinate court and convicted the accused person and sentenced him to imprisonment for <strong>life or for ten years</strong>.</p><p>Further, the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court extends to all civil and criminal cases in which the <strong>Federal Court of India</strong> had jurisdiction to hear appeals from the high court but which are not covered under the civil and criminal appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court mentioned above.</p><h3>(d) Appeal by Special Leave</h3><p>The Supreme Court is authorised to grant in its discretion <strong>special leave to appeal</strong> from any judgment in any matter passed by any court or tribunal in the country (except <strong>military tribunal</strong> and <strong>court martial</strong>). This provision contains the four aspects as under:
(i) It is a <strong>discretionary power</strong> and hence, cannot be claimed as a matter of right.
(ii) It can be granted in any judgment whether final or interlocutory.
(iii) It may be related to any matter–constitutional, civil, criminal, income-tax, labour, revenue, advocates, etc.
(iv) It can be granted against any court or tribunal and not necessarily against a high court (of course, except a military court).</p><p>Thus, the scope of this provision is very wide and it vests the Supreme Court with a <strong>plenary jurisdiction</strong> to hear appeals. On the exercise of this power, the Supreme Court itself held that</p><blockquote><p>‘being an exceptional and overriding power, it has to be exercised sparingly and with caution and only in special extraordinary situations. Beyond that it is not possible to fetter the exercise of this power by any set formula or rule’.</p></blockquote><h3>4. Advisory Jurisdiction</h3><p>The <strong>Constitution</strong> (Article 143) authorises the <strong>president</strong> to seek the opinion of the <strong>Supreme Court</strong> in the two categories of matters:
(a) On any question of <strong>law or fact of public importance</strong> which has arisen or which is likely to arise.
(b) On any dispute arising out of any <strong>pre-constitution treaty, agreement, covenant, engagement, sanad</strong> or other similar instruments.</p><p>In the first case, the Supreme Court <strong>may tender or may refuse to tender</strong> its opinion to the president. But, in the second case, the Supreme Court <strong>must</strong> tender its opinion to the president. In both cases, the opinion expressed by the Supreme Court is only <strong>advisory</strong> and not a judicial pronouncement. Hence, it is not binding on the president; he may follow or may not follow the opinion. However, it facilitates the government to have an authoritative legal opinion on a matter to be decided by it.</p><p>So far (2019), the president has made <strong>fifteen references</strong> to the Supreme Court under its advisory jurisdiction (also known as consultative jurisdiction). These are mentioned below in chronological order:</p><ol><li><strong>Delhi Laws Act</strong> in 1951</li><li><strong>Kerala Education Bill</strong> in 1958</li><li><strong>Berubari Union</strong> in 1960</li><li><strong>Sea Customs Act</strong> in 1963</li><li><strong>Keshav Singh’s case</strong> relating to the privileges of the Legislature in 1964</li><li><strong>Presidential Election</strong> in 1974</li><li><strong>Special Courts Bill</strong> in 1978</li><li><strong>Jammu and Kashmir Resettlement Act</strong> in 1982</li><li><strong>Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal</strong> in 1992</li><li><strong>Rama Janma Bhumi case</strong> in 1993</li><li><strong>Consultation process</strong> to be adopted by the chief justice of India in 1998</li><li><strong>Legislative competence</strong> of the Centre and States on the subject of natural gas and liquefied natural gas in 2001</li><li>The constitutional validity of the <strong>Election Commission’s decision</strong> on deferring the Gujarat Assembly Elections in 2002</li><li><strong>Punjab Termination of Agreements Act</strong> in 2004</li><li><strong>2G spectrum case verdict</strong> and the mandatory auctioning of natural resources across all sectors in 2012</li></ol><h3>5. A Court of Record</h3><p>As a <strong>Court of Record</strong>, the <strong>Supreme Court</strong> has two powers:
(a) The <strong>judgments, proceedings, and acts</strong> of the Supreme Court are recorded for perpetual memory and testimony. These records are admitted to be of <strong>evidentiary value</strong> and cannot be questioned when produced before any court. They are recognised as <strong>legal precedents</strong> and legal references.
(b) It has the power to <strong>punish for contempt of court</strong>, either with simple imprisonment for a term up to six months or with a fine up to ₹2,000 or with both. In 1991, the Supreme Court ruled that it has the power to punish for contempt not only of itself but also of <strong>high courts, subordinate courts,</strong> and <strong>tribunals</strong> functioning in the entire country.</p><p><strong>Contempt of court</strong> may be <strong>civil</strong> or <strong>criminal</strong>.</p><ul><li><strong>Civil contempt</strong> means willful disobedience to any judgment, order, writ, or other process of a court or willful breach of an undertaking given to a court.</li><li><strong>Criminal contempt</strong> means the publication of any matter or doing an act which:
(i) scandalises or lowers the authority of a court; or
(ii) prejudices or interferes with the due course of a judicial proceeding; or
(iii) interferes or obstructs the administration of justice in any other manner.</li></ul><p>However, <strong>innocent publication</strong> and distribution of some matter, <strong>fair and accurate report</strong> of judicial proceedings, <strong>fair and reasonable criticism</strong> of judicial acts, and comment on the administrative side of the judiciary do not amount to contempt of court.</p><h3>6. Power of Judicial Review</h3><p><strong>Judicial review</strong> is the power of the <strong>Supreme Court</strong> to examine the constitutionality of legislative enactments and executive orders of both the <strong>Central and state governments</strong>. On examination, if they are found to be violative of the <strong>Constitution</strong> (ultra-vires), they can be declared as illegal, unconstitutional, and invalid (null and void) by the Supreme Court. Consequently, they cannot be enforced by the Government.</p><h3>7. Constitutional Interpretation</h3><p>The Supreme Court is the <strong>ultimate interpreter of the Constitution</strong>. It can give the final version to the spirit and content of the provisions of the Constitution and the verbiage used in the Constitution. While interpreting the Constitution, the Supreme Court is guided by a number of <strong>doctrines</strong>. In other words, the Supreme Court applies various doctrines in interpreting the Constitution. The important doctrines are mentioned below:</p><ol><li><strong>Doctrine of Severability</strong></li><li><strong>Doctrine of Waiver</strong></li><li><strong>Doctrine of Eclipse</strong></li><li><strong>Doctrine of Territorial Nexus</strong></li><li><strong>Doctrine of Pith and Substance</strong></li><li><strong>Doctrine of Colourable Legislation</strong></li><li><strong>Doctrine of Implied Powers</strong></li><li><strong>Doctrine of Incidental and Ancillary Powers</strong></li><li><strong>Doctrine of Precedent</strong></li><li><strong>Doctrine of Occupied Field</strong></li><li><strong>Doctrine of Prospective Overruling</strong></li><li><strong>Doctrine of Harmonious Construction</strong></li><li><strong>Doctrine of Liberal Interpretation</strong></li></ol><h3>8. Other Powers</h3><p>Besides the above, the Supreme Court has numerous other powers:
(a) It decides the disputes regarding the election of the <strong>president and the vice president</strong>. In this regard, it has the original, exclusive, and final authority.
(b) It enquires into the conduct and behaviour of the <strong>chairman and members of the Union Public Service Commission</strong> on a reference made by the president. If it finds them guilty of misbehaviour, it can recommend to the president for their removal. The advice tendered by the Supreme Court in this regard is binding on the president.
(c) It has the power to <strong>review its own judgment or order</strong>. Thus, it is not bound by its previous decision and can depart from it in the interest of justice or community welfare. In brief, the Supreme Court is a self-correcting agency. For example, in the <strong>Kesavananda Bharati case (1973)</strong>, the Supreme Court departed from its previous judgment in the <strong>Golak Nath case (1967)</strong>.
(d) It is authorised to <strong>withdraw the cases pending</strong> before the high courts and dispose of them by itself. It can also transfer a case or appeal pending before one high court to another high court.
(e) Its law is <strong>binding on all courts</strong> in India. Its decree or order is enforceable throughout the country. All authorities (civil and judicial) in the country should act in aid of the Supreme Court.
(f) It has the power of <strong>judicial superintendence and control</strong> over all the courts and tribunals functioning in the entire territory of the country.</p><p>The Supreme Court’s jurisdiction and powers with respect to matters in the <strong>Union list</strong> can be enlarged by the <strong>Parliament</strong>. Further, its jurisdiction and powers with respect to other matters can be enlarged by a special agreement of the <strong>Centre and the states</strong>.</p><h3>SUPREME COURT ADVOCATES</h3><p>Three categories of advocates are entitled to practice law before the <strong>Supreme Court</strong>. They are:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Senior Advocates</strong>
These are advocates who are designated as <strong>Senior Advocates</strong> by the Supreme Court of India or by any High Court. The Court can designate any advocate, with his consent, as Senior Advocate if, in its opinion, by virtue of his ability, standing at the Bar, or special knowledge or experience in law, the said advocate is deserving of such distinction. A Senior Advocate is not entitled to appear without an <strong>Advocate-on-Record</strong> in the Supreme Court or without a junior in any other court or tribunal in India. He is also not entitled to accept instructions to draw pleadings or affidavits, advise on evidence, or do any drafting work of an analogous kind in any court or tribunal in India or undertake conveyancing work of any kind whatsoever. However, this prohibition shall not extend to settling any such matter as aforesaid in consultation with a junior.</p></li><li><p><strong>Advocates-on-Record</strong>
Only these advocates are entitled to <strong>file any matter or document</strong> before the Supreme Court. They can also file an appearance or act for a party in the Supreme Court.</p></li><li><p><strong>Other Advocates</strong>
These are advocates whose names are entered on the roll of any <strong>State Bar Council</strong> maintained under the <strong>Advocates Act, 1961</strong>. They can appear and argue any matter on behalf of a party in the Supreme Court but they are not entitled to file any document or matter before the Court.</p></li></ol><h3>Judicial Review</h3><p>The <strong>doctrine of judicial review</strong> originated and developed in the <strong>USA</strong>. It was propounded for the first time in the famous case of <strong>Marbury versus Madison (1803)</strong> by <strong>John Marshall</strong>, the then chief justice of the American Supreme Court. In India, on the other hand, the <strong>Constitution</strong> itself confers the power of judicial review on the judiciary (both the <strong>Supreme Court</strong> as well as <strong>High Courts</strong>). Further, the Supreme Court has declared the power of judicial review as a <strong>basic feature</strong> of the Constitution or an element of the <strong>basic structure</strong> of the Constitution. Hence, the power of judicial review cannot be curtailed or excluded even by a constitutional amendment.</p><h3>Meaning of Judicial Review</h3><p><strong>Judicial review</strong> is the power of the judiciary to examine the constitutionality of legislative enactments and executive orders of both the <strong>Central and State governments</strong>. On examination, if they are found to be violative of the <strong>Constitution</strong> (ultra vires), they can be declared as illegal, unconstitutional, and invalid (null and void) by the judiciary. Consequently, they cannot be enforced by the Government.</p><p><strong>Justice Syed Shah Mohamed Quadri</strong> has classified the judicial review into the following three categories:</p><ol><li><strong>Judicial review of constitutional amendments.</strong></li><li><strong>Judicial review of legislation</strong> of the Parliament and State Legislatures and subordinate legislations.</li><li><strong>Judicial review of administrative action</strong> of the Union and State and authorities under the state.</li></ol><p>The Supreme Court used the power of judicial review in various cases, for example, the <strong>Golaknath case (1967)</strong>, the <strong>Bank Nationalisation case (1970)</strong>, the <strong>Privy Purses Abolition case (1971)</strong>, the <strong>Kesavananda Bharati case (1973)</strong>, the <strong>Minerva Mills case (1980)</strong>, and so on.</p><p>In <strong>2015</strong>, the Supreme Court declared both the <strong>99th Constitutional Amendment, 2014</strong> and the <strong>National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) Act, 2014</strong> as unconstitutional and null and void.</p><h3>Importance of Judicial Review</h3><p><strong>Judicial review</strong> is needed for the following reasons:
(a) To uphold the principle of the <strong>supremacy of the Constitution</strong>.
(b) To maintain <strong>federal equilibrium</strong> (balance between the Centre and the states).
(c) To protect the <strong>Fundamental Rights</strong> of the citizens.</p><p>In a number of cases, the <strong>Supreme Court</strong> has pointed out the significance of the power of judicial review in our country. Some of the observations made by it, in this regard, are given below:</p><blockquote><p>"In India it is the Constitution that is supreme and that a statute law to be valid, must be in conformity with the constitutional requirements and it is for the judiciary to decide whether any enactment is constitutional or not."</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>"Our constitution contains express provisions for judicial review of legislation as to its conformity with the constitution. This is especially true as regards the Fundamental Rights, to which the court has been assigned the role of sentinel on the qui vive."</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>"As long as some Fundamental Rights exist and are a part of the Constitution, the power of judicial review has also to be exercised with a view to see that the guarantees afforded by these Rights are not contravened."</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>"The Constitution is supreme lex, the permanent law of the land, and there is no branch of government above it. Every organ of government, be it the executive or the legislature or the judiciary, derives its authority from the Constitution and it has to act within the limits of its authority. No one however highly placed and no authority howsoever lofty, can claim that it shall be the sole judge of the extent of its power under the Constitution or whether its action is within the confines of such power laid down by the constitution. This Court is the ultimate interpreter of the Constitution and to this Court is assigned the delicate task of determining what is the power conferred on each branch of government, whether it is limited, and if so, what are the limits and whether any action of that branch transgresses such limits."</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>"It is the function of the Judges, nay their duty, to pronounce upon the validity of laws. If courts are totally deprived of that power, the Fundamental Rights conferred on the people will become a mere adornment because rights without remedies are as writ in water. A controlled Constitution will then become uncontrolled."</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>"The judges of the Supreme Court have been entrusted with the task of upholding the Constitution and to this end, have been conferred the power to interpret it. It is they who have to ensure that the balance of power envisaged by the Constitution is maintained and that the legislature and the executive do not, in the discharge of their functions, transgress constitutional limitations."</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>"The founding fathers very wisely, therefore, incorporated in the Constitution itself the provisions of judicial review so as to maintain the balance of federalism, to protect the Fundamental Rights and Fundamental Freedoms guaranteed to the citizens and to afford a useful weapon for availability, availment and enjoyment of equality, liberty and Fundamental Freedoms and to help to create a healthy nationalism. The function of judicial review is a part of the constitutional interpretation itself. It adjusts the Constitution to meet new conditions and needs of the time."</p></blockquote><h3>Constitutional Provisions for Judicial Review</h3><p>Though the phrase ‘<strong>Judicial Review</strong>’ has nowhere been used in the <strong>Constitution</strong>, the provisions of several Articles explicitly confer the power of judicial review on the <strong>Supreme Court</strong> and the <strong>High Courts</strong>. These provisions are explained below:</p><ol><li><strong>Article 13</strong> declares that all laws that are inconsistent with or in derogation of the <strong>Fundamental Rights</strong> shall be null and void.</li><li><strong>Article 32</strong> guarantees the right to move the <strong>Supreme Court</strong> for the enforcement of the Fundamental Rights and empowers the Supreme Court to issue directions or orders or writs for that purpose.</li><li><strong>Article 131</strong> provides for the <strong>original jurisdiction</strong> of the Supreme Court in <strong>centre-state and inter-state disputes</strong>.</li><li><strong>Article 132</strong> provides for the <strong>appellate jurisdiction</strong> of the Supreme Court in <strong>constitutional cases</strong>.</li><li><strong>Article 133</strong> provides for the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in <strong>civil cases</strong>.</li><li><strong>Article 134</strong> provides for the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in <strong>criminal cases</strong>.</li><li><strong>Article 134-A</strong> deals with the certificate for appeal to the Supreme Court from the <strong>High Courts</strong>.</li><li><strong>Article 135</strong> empowers the Supreme Court to exercise the jurisdiction and powers of the <strong>Federal Court</strong> under any pre-constitution law.</li><li><strong>Article 136</strong> authorises the Supreme Court to grant <strong>special leave to appeal</strong> from any court or tribunal (except military tribunal and court martial).</li><li><strong>Article 143</strong> authorises the <strong>President</strong> to seek the opinion of the Supreme Court on any question of law or fact and on any pre-constitution legal matters.</li><li><strong>Article 226</strong> empowers the <strong>High Courts</strong> to issue directions or orders or writs for the enforcement of the <strong>Fundamental Rights</strong> and for any other purpose.</li><li><strong>Article 227</strong> vests in the High Courts the power of <strong>superintendence</strong> over all courts and tribunals within their respective territorial jurisdictions (except military courts or tribunals).</li><li><strong>Article 245</strong> deals with the <strong>territorial extent</strong> of laws made by Parliament and by the Legislatures of States.</li><li><strong>Article 246</strong> deals with the <strong>subject matter</strong> of laws made by Parliament and by the Legislatures of States (i.e., Union List, State List, and Concurrent List).</li><li><strong>Articles 251 and 254</strong> provide that in case of a conflict between the <strong>central law and state law</strong>, the central law prevails over the state law and the state law shall be void.</li><li><strong>Article 372</strong> deals with the continuance in force of the <strong>pre-constitution laws</strong>.</li></ol><h3>Scope of Judicial Review</h3><p>The constitutional validity of a legislative enactment or an executive order can be challenged in the <strong>Supreme Court</strong> or in the <strong>High Courts</strong> on the following three grounds:
(a) It infringes the <strong>Fundamental Rights</strong> (Part III).
(b) It is outside the <strong>competence</strong> of the authority which has framed it.
(c) It is <strong>repugnant</strong> to the constitutional provisions.</p><p>From the above, it is clear that the scope of <strong>judicial review</strong> in India is narrower than what exists in the <strong>USA</strong>, though the American Constitution does not explicitly mention the concept of judicial review in any of its provisions. This is because the American Constitution provides for <strong>‘due process of law’</strong> against that of <strong>‘procedure established by law’</strong> which is contained in the Indian Constitution. The difference between the two is:</p><blockquote><p>“The due process of law gives wide scope to the Supreme Court to grant protection to the rights of its citizens. It can declare laws violative of these rights void not only on substantive grounds of being unlawful but also on procedural grounds of being unreasonable. Our Supreme Court, while determining the constitutionality of a law, however, examines only the substantive question, i.e., whether the law is within the powers of the authority concerned or not. It is not expected to go into the question of its reasonableness, suitability or policy implications.”</p></blockquote><p>The exercise of wide power of judicial review by the American Supreme Court in the name of <strong>‘due process of law’</strong> clause has made the critics describe it as a <strong>‘third chamber’</strong> of the Legislature, a super-legislature, the arbiter of social policy, and so on. This American principle of <strong>judicial supremacy</strong> is also recognised in our constitutional system, but to a limited extent.</p><p>Nor do we fully follow the <strong>British Principle</strong> of parliamentary supremacy. There are many limitations on the sovereignty of Parliament in our country, like the written character of the Constitution, the federalism with division of powers, the Fundamental Rights, and the judicial review. In effect, what exists in India is a synthesis of both the American principle of judicial supremacy and the British principle of parliamentary supremacy.</p><h3>Judicial Review of the Ninth Schedule</h3><p><strong>Article 31B</strong> saves the acts and regulations included in the <strong>Ninth Schedule</strong> from being challenged and invalidated on the ground of contravention of any of the <strong>Fundamental Rights</strong>. Article 31B, along with the Ninth Schedule, was added by the <strong>1st Constitutional Amendment Act of 1951</strong>.</p><p>Originally (in 1951), the Ninth Schedule contained only <strong>13 acts and regulations</strong>, but at present (in 2016), their number is <strong>282</strong>. Of these, the acts and regulations of the <strong>state legislature</strong> deal with <strong>land reforms</strong> and the abolition of the <strong>zamindari system</strong>, and those of the <strong>Parliament</strong> deal with other matters.</p><p>However, in a significant judgment delivered in <strong>I.R. Coelho case (2007)</strong>, the <strong>Supreme Court</strong> ruled that there could not be any blanket immunity from judicial review of laws included in the Ninth Schedule. The court held that <strong>judicial review</strong> is a <strong>‘basic feature’</strong> of the Constitution and it could not be taken away by putting a law under the Ninth Schedule. It said that the laws placed under the Ninth Schedule after <strong>April 24, 1973</strong>, are open to challenge in court if they violated <strong>Fundamental Rights</strong> guaranteed under the Articles <strong>14, 15, 19,</strong> and <strong>21</strong> or the <strong>‘basic structure’</strong> of the Constitution. It was on April 24, 1973, that the Supreme Court first propounded the doctrine of <strong>‘basic structure’</strong> or <strong>‘basic features’</strong> of the Constitution in its landmark verdict in the <strong>Kesavananda Bharati case</strong>.</p><p>While delivering the above judgement, the <strong>Supreme Court</strong> made the following conclusions:</p><ol><li><p><strong>A law that abrogates or abridges rights guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution may violate the basic structure doctrine, or it may not.</strong> If the former is the consequence of law, whether by an amendment of any Article of Part III or by an insertion in the <strong>Ninth Schedule</strong>, such law will have to be invalidated in the exercise of judicial review power of the Court. The constitutional validity of the Ninth Schedule laws on the touchstone of basic structure doctrine can be adjudged by applying the <strong>direct impact and effect test</strong>, i.e., <strong>rights test</strong>, which means the form of an amendment is not the relevant factor, but the consequence thereof would be the determinative factor.</p></li><li><p><strong>The majority judgement in the Kesavanand Bharati Case read with Indira Gandhi case requires the validity of each new constitutional amendment to be judged on its own merits.</strong> The actual effect and impact of the law on the rights guaranteed under Part III has to be taken into account for determining whether or not it destroys basic structure. The impact test would determine the validity of the challenge.</p></li><li><p><strong>All amendments to the Constitution made on or after 24th April, 1973, by which the Ninth Schedule is amended by inclusion of various laws therein, shall have to be tested on the touchstone of the basic or essential features of the Constitution as reflected in Article 21 read with Articles 14 and 19 and the principles underlying them.</strong> To put it differently, even though an act is put in the Ninth Schedule by a Constitutional Amendment, its provisions would be open to attack on the ground that they destroy or damage the basic structure if the Fundamental Right or rights taken away or abrogated pertain to the basic structure.</p></li><li><p><strong>Justification for conferring protection, not blanket protection, on the laws included in the Ninth Schedule by Constitutional Amendments shall be a matter of constitutional adjudication by examining the nature and extent of infraction of a Fundamental Right by a statute, sought to be constitutionally protected, and on the touchstone of the basic structure doctrine as reflected in Article 21 read with Articles 14 and 19 by application of the “rights test” and the “essence of the right” test taking the synoptic view of the articles in Part III as held in the Indira Gandhi Case.</strong> Applying the above test to the Ninth Schedule laws, if the infraction affects the basic structure, then such a law or laws will not get the protection of the Ninth Schedule. When the triangle of Article 21 read with Article 14 and Article 19 is sought to be eliminated not only the “essence of the right” test but also the “rights test” has to apply. There is also a difference between the “rights test” and the “essence of the right” test. Both form part of application of the basic structure doctrine. When in a controlled constitution conferring limited power of amendment, an entire chapter is made inapplicable, the “essence of the right” test as applied in Nagaraj case will have no applicability. In such a situation, to judge the validity of the law, it is the “rights test” which is more appropriate.</p></li><li><p><strong>If the validity of any Ninth Schedule law has already been upheld by this Court, it would not be open to challenge such law again on the principles declared by this judgment.</strong> However, if a law held to be violative of any rights in Part III is subsequently incorporated in the Ninth Schedule after 24th April, 1973, such a violation/infraction shall be open to challenge on the ground that it destroys or damages the basic structure as indicated in Article 21 read with Articles 14 and 19 and the principles underlying them.</p></li><li><p><strong>Action taken and transactions finalized as a result of the impugned Acts shall not be open to challenge.</strong></p></li></ol><p>The number of acts and regulations included in the Ninth Schedule before and after April 24, 1973, are mentioned below in Table 27.1.</p><h3>Judicial Activism</h3><p>The concept of <strong>judicial activism</strong> originated and developed in the <strong>USA</strong>. This term was first coined in <strong>1947</strong> by <strong>Arthur Schlesinger Jr.</strong>, an American historian and educator.</p><p>In India, the doctrine of judicial activism was introduced in the mid-1970s. <strong>Justice V.R. Krishna Iyer, Justice P.N. Bhagwati, Justice O. Chinnappa Reddy,</strong> and <strong>Justice D.A. Desai</strong> laid the foundations of judicial activism in the country.</p><h3>Meaning of Judicial Activism</h3><p><strong>Judicial activism</strong> denotes the proactive role played by the judiciary in the protection of the rights of citizens and in the promotion of justice in society. In other words, it implies the assertive role played by the judiciary to force the other two organs of the government (legislature and executive) to discharge their constitutional duties.</p><p>Judicial activism is also known as <strong>“judicial dynamism”</strong>. It is the antithesis of <strong>“judicial restraint”</strong>, which means the self-control exercised by the judiciary.</p><p>Judicial activism is defined in the following ways:</p><ol><li><strong>“Judicial activism is a way of exercising judicial power that motivates judges to depart from normally practised strict adherence to judicial precedent in favour of progressive and new social policies. It is commonly marked by decision calling for social engineering, and occasionally these decisions represent intrusion in the legislative and executive matters.”</strong></li><li><strong>“Judicial activism is the practice in the judiciary of protecting or expanding individual rights through decisions that depart from established precedent, or are independent of, or in opposition to supposed constitutional or legislation intent.”</strong></li><li><strong>“Judicial activism can be defined as the process of lawmaking by judges. It means an active interpretation of existing legislation by a judge, made with a view to enhance the utility of that legislation for social betterment. Judicial activism is different from judicial pessimism which means interpretation of existing provisions of law, without an attempt to enhance its beneficial aspects.”</strong></li><li><strong>“Judicial activism is a philosophy of judicial decision-making whereby judges allow their personal views about public policy, among other factors, to guide their decisions.”</strong></li><li><strong>“Judicial activism is a procedure to evolve new principles, concepts, maxims, formulae and relief to do justice or to expand the standing of the litigant and open the door of courts for needy or to entertain litigation affecting the entire society or a section of it.”</strong></li></ol><p>The concept of judicial activism is closely related to the concept of <strong>Public Interest Litigation (PIL)</strong>. It is the judicial activism of the Supreme Court which is the major factor for the rise of PIL. In other words, PIL is an outcome of judicial activism. In fact, PIL is the most popular form (or manifestation) of judicial activism.</p><h3>Judicial Review and Judicial Activism</h3><p>The concepts of <strong>judicial review</strong> and <strong>judicial activism</strong> are closely related to each other. However, there are distinct differences between them. The following points highlight these differences:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Judicial Review vs. Judicial Activism:</strong></p><ul><li>Since about the mid-20th century, a version of judicial review has acquired the nickname of judicial activism, especially in the <strong>USA</strong>. In India, the participants in the debate mix up judicial activism with judicial review. The former is that form of the latter in which judges participate in law-making policies, i.e., not only do they uphold or invalidate laws in terms of constitutional provisions, but they also exercise their policy preferences in doing so.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Inherent Nature of Judicial Activism:</strong></p><ul><li>The concept of judicial activism is inherent in judicial review, which empowers the court to uphold the <strong>constitution</strong> and declare the laws and actions inconsistent with the constitution as void. Judicial activism is necessary for ensuring proper discharge of duties by other organs.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Judicial Activism Definition:</strong></p><ul><li>The term <strong>“judicial activism”</strong> came into currency sometime in the 20th century to describe the act of judicial legislation, i.e., judges making positive law. However, there is no standard definition of the term <strong>“judicial activism”</strong>. As a whole, it can be said that judicial activism stresses the importance of judicial review and a powerful judiciary in the protection and promotion of certain core rights.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Expanded Concept of Locus Standi:</strong></p><ul><li>The expanded concept of <strong>locus standi</strong> in connection with <strong>PIL</strong>, by judicial interpretation from time to time, has expanded the jurisdictional limits of the courts exercising judicial review. This expanded role has been given the title of <strong>“judicial activism”</strong> by those who are critical of this expanded role of the judiciary.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Judicial Activism in Constitutional Cases:</strong></p><ul><li>Judicial activism, as regards constitutional cases, falls under the rubric of what is commonly called judicial review. At the broadest level, it is any occasion where a court intervenes and strikes down a piece of duly enacted legislation.</li></ul></li></ol><h3>Justification of Judicial Activism</h3><p>According to Dr. <strong>B.L. Wadehra</strong>, the reasons for judicial activism are as follows:</p><ol><li><strong>Near Collapse of Responsible Government</strong>: When the <strong>Legislature</strong> and <strong>Executive</strong> fail to discharge their respective functions, it results in erosion of the confidence in the <strong>Constitution</strong> and democracy among the citizens.</li><li><strong>Protection of Rights and Freedoms</strong>: The citizens of the country look up to the judiciary for the protection of their rights and freedoms, leading to tremendous pressure on the judiciary to step in and aid the suffering masses.</li><li><strong>Judicial Enthusiasm</strong>: Judges may wish to participate in social reforms that take place in changing times. This encourages <strong>Public Interest Litigation (PIL)</strong> and liberalises the principle of <strong>‘Locus Standi’</strong>.</li><li><strong>Legislative Vacuum</strong>: There may be certain areas that have not been legislated upon, requiring the court to engage in <strong>judicial legislation</strong> to meet changing social needs.</li><li><strong>Constitutional Provisions</strong>: The <strong>Constitution of India</strong> has itself adopted certain provisions that give the judiciary enough scope to legislate or play an active role.</li></ol><p>Similarly, <strong>Subhash Kashyap</strong> observes that certain eventualities may be conceived when the judiciary may have to overstep its normal jurisdiction and intervene in areas otherwise falling within the domain of the legislature and the executive:</p><ol><li><strong>Failure of Legislature</strong>: When the legislature fails to discharge its responsibilities.</li><li><strong>'Hung' Legislature</strong>: In case of a <strong>‘hung’ legislature</strong>, where the government is weak, insecure, and focused only on survival, unable to take any decision that displeases any caste, community, or other group.</li><li><strong>Fear of Losing Power</strong>: Those in power may be afraid of taking honest and hard decisions for fear of losing power, leading to public issues being referred to courts as issues of law to mark time and delay decisions or to pass on the responsibility of strong decision-making to the courts.</li><li><strong>Protection of Basic Rights</strong>: Where the legislature and the executive fail to protect the basic rights of citizens, such as the right to live a decent life, healthy surroundings, or to provide an honest, efficient, and just system of laws and administration.</li><li><strong>Misuse of Court of Law</strong>: Where the court of law is misused by a strong authoritarian parliamentary party government for ulterior motives, as was attempted during the <strong>Emergency aberration</strong>.</li><li><strong>Populism and Publicity</strong>: Sometimes, the courts themselves knowingly or unknowingly become victims of human weaknesses for populism, publicity, and media attention.</li></ol><p>According to Dr. <strong>Vandana</strong>, the concept of judicial activism can be seen reflecting from the following trends:</p><ol><li><strong>Expansion of Rights of Hearing</strong>: In the administrative process.</li><li><strong>Excessive Delegation without Limitation</strong>: Where there is a lack of proper limitation on delegation.</li><li><strong>Judicial Control over Discretionary Powers</strong>: Expansion of judicial control over discretionary powers.</li><li><strong>Judicial Review over Administration</strong>: Expansion of judicial review over administrative actions.</li><li><strong>Promotion of Open Government</strong>: Encouraging transparency in government operations.</li><li><strong>Indiscriminate Exercise of Contempt Power</strong>: Use of contempt powers without proper discretion.</li><li><strong>Exercise of Jurisdiction when Non-existent</strong>: Courts taking on jurisdiction where it does not exist.</li><li><strong>Over-extending Interpretation</strong>: Extending standard rules of interpretation to achieve economic, social, and educational objectives.</li><li><strong>Passing Unworkable Orders</strong>: Issuing orders that are inherently unworkable.</li></ol><h3>Activators of Judicial Activism</h3><p><strong>Upendra Baxi</strong>, an eminent jurist, has delineated the following typology of social/human rights activists who activated judicial activism:</p><ol><li><strong>Civil Rights Activists</strong>: These groups primarily focus on <strong>civil and political rights</strong> issues.</li><li><strong>People Rights Activists</strong>: These groups focus on <strong>social and economic rights</strong> within the contexts of state repression of people’s movements.</li><li><strong>Consumer Rights Groups</strong>: These formations raise issues of <strong>consumer rights</strong> within the framework of accountability of the polity and the economy.</li><li><strong>Bonded Labour Groups</strong>: These groups advocate for the <strong>annihilation of wage slavery</strong> in India.</li><li><strong>Citizens for Environmental Action</strong>: These groups activate an activist judiciary to combat increasing <strong>environmental degradation and pollution</strong>.</li><li><strong>Citizen Groups against Large Irrigation Projects</strong>: These activist formations ask the Indian judiciary to <strong>cease and desist from ordering against mega irrigation projects</strong>.</li><li><strong>Rights of Child Groups</strong>: These groups focus on <strong>child labour</strong>, the <strong>right to literacy</strong>, <strong>juveniles in custodial institutions</strong>, and <strong>rights of children born to sex workers</strong>.</li><li><strong>Custodial Rights Groups</strong>: These groups include social action by <strong>prisoners’ rights groups</strong>, <strong>women under state 'protective' custody</strong>, and <strong>persons under preventive detention</strong>.</li><li><strong>Poverty Rights Groups</strong>: These groups litigate issues concerning <strong>drought and famine relief</strong> and <strong>urban impoverished</strong>.</li><li><strong>Indigenous People’s Rights Groups</strong>: These groups agitate for issues of <strong>forest dwellers</strong>, citizens of the <strong>Fifth and Sixth Schedules</strong> of the Indian Constitution, and <strong>identity rights</strong>.</li><li><strong>Women’s Rights Groups</strong>: These groups agitate for issues of <strong>gender equality</strong>, <strong>gender-based violence and harassment</strong>, <strong>rape</strong>, and <strong>dowry murders</strong>.</li><li><strong>Bar-based Groups</strong>: These associations agitate for issues concerning the <strong>autonomy and accountability</strong> of the Indian judiciary.</li><li><strong>Media Autonomy Groups</strong>: These groups focus on the <strong>autonomy and accountability of the press</strong> and instruments of <strong>mass media owned by the State</strong>.</li><li><strong>Assorted Lawyer-Based Groups</strong>: This category includes critically influential <strong>lawyers’ groups</strong> which agitate for various causes.</li><li><strong>Assorted Individual Petitioners</strong>: This category includes <strong>freelance activist individuals</strong>.</li></ol><h3>Apprehensions of Judicial Activism</h3><p>The same jurist, <strong>Upendra Baxi</strong>, also presented a typology of fears generated by judicial activism. He observes:</p><blockquote><p>"The facts entail invocation of a wide range of fears. The invocation is designed to bring into a nervous rationality among India’s most conscientious justices."</p></blockquote><p>He described the following types of fears:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Ideological Fears</strong>:</p><ul><li>Are they usurping powers of the legislature, the executive, or other autonomous institutions in a civil society?</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Epistemic Fears</strong>:</p><ul><li>Do they have enough knowledge in economic matters like <strong>Manmohan Singh</strong>, in scientific matters like the <strong>Czars of the atomic energy establishment</strong>, the captains of the <strong>Council of Scientific and Industrial Research</strong>, and so on?</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Management Fears</strong>:</p><ul><li>Are they doing justice by adding this kind of litigation workload to a situation of <strong>staggering growth of arrears</strong>?</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Legitimation Fears</strong>:</p><ul><li>Are they causing depletion of their symbolic and instrumental authority by passing orders in public interest litigation which the executive may bypass or ignore? Wouldn't the people's faith in judiciary, a democratic recourse, be thus eroded?</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Democratic Fears</strong>:</p><ul><li>Is a profusion of public interest litigation <strong>nurturing democracy</strong> or depleting its potential for the future?</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Biographic Fears</strong>:</p><ul><li>What would be my place in national affairs after <strong>superannuation</strong> if I overdo this kind of litigation?</li></ul></li></ol><h3>Apprehensions of Judicial Activism</h3><p>The same jurist, <strong>Upendra Baxi</strong>, presented a typology of fears generated by judicial activism.

Those who subscribe to judicial restraint contend that the role of judges should be scrupulously limited; their job is merely to say what the law is, leaving the business of lawmaking where it properly belongs, that is, with the legislators and the executives. Under no circumstances, moreover, should judges allow their personal political values and policy agendas to colour their judicial opinions. This view holds that the <strong>‘original intent’</strong> of the authors of the constitution and its amendments is knowable, and must guide the courts.</p><h4>Assumptions of Judicial Restraint</h4><p>In the USA, the doctrine of judicial restraint is based on the following six assumptions:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Undemocratic Nature of the Court</strong>:</p><ul><li>The Court is basically undemocratic because it is non-elective and presumably non-responsive to the popular will. Because of its alleged oligarchic composition, the court should defer wherever possible to the <strong>‘more’ democratic branches of government</strong>.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Questionable Origins of Judicial Review</strong>:</p><ul><li>The <strong>great power of judicial review</strong> is not specifically granted by the Constitution.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Doctrine of Separation of Powers</strong>:</p><ul><li>The doctrine emphasizes that the judiciary should not encroach upon the domains of the legislative and executive branches.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Concept of Federalism</strong>:</p><ul><li>Dividing powers between the nation and the states requires the Court to <strong>defer to the actions of state governments and officials</strong>.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Pragmatic Assumption</strong>:</p><ul><li>Since the Court is dependent on the Congress for its jurisdiction and resources, and dependent on public acceptance for its effectiveness, it ought not to overstep its boundaries without consideration of the risks involved.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Aristocratic Notion</strong>:</p><ul><li>Being a court of law and inheritor and custodian of the <strong>Anglo-American legal tradition</strong>, the judiciary ought not to delve too deeply into the realm of politics, which is concerned with power and influence, while law is the process of reason and judgment.</li></ul></li></ol><p>From the above, it is clear that all the assumptions (except the second dealing with judicial review) hold good in the <strong>Indian</strong> context too.</p><h3>Supreme Court Observations</h3><p>While delivering a judgement in December 2007, the <strong>Supreme Court of India</strong> called for <strong>judicial restraint</strong> and asked courts not to take over the functions of the legislature or the executive, emphasizing the broad separation of powers under the Constitution. Each organ of the state must have respect for others and should not encroach on others’ domain. In this context, the concerned Bench of the court made the following observations:</p><ol><li><p>The Bench said, <strong>“We are repeatedly coming across cases where judges are unjustifiably trying to perform executive or legislative functions. This is clearly unconstitutional. In the name of judicial activism, judges cannot cross their limits and try to take over functions which belong to another organ of the state.”</strong></p></li><li><p>The Bench said, <strong>“Judges must know their limits and must not try to run the government. They must have modesty and humility, and not behave like emperors.”</strong></p></li><li><p>Quoting from the book <strong>‘The Spirit of Laws’ by Montesquieu</strong> on the consequences of not maintaining separation of powers among the three organs, the Bench said the French political philosopher’s <strong>“warning is particularly apt and timely for the Indian judiciary today, since very often it is rightly criticised for ‘overreach’ and encroachment on the domain of the other two organs.”</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Judicial activism must not become judicial adventurism</strong>, the Bench warned the courts. Adjudication must be done within the system of historically validated restraints and conscious minimisation of judges’ preferences.</p></li><li><p><strong>“The courts must not embarrass administrative authorities and must realise that administrative authorities have expertise in the field of administration while the court does not.”</strong></p></li><li><p>The Bench said, <strong>“The justification often given for judicial encroachment on the domain of the executive or the legislature is that the other two organs are not doing their jobs properly. Even assuming this is so, the same allegations can be made against the judiciary too because there are cases pending in courts for half-a-century.”</strong></p></li><li><p>If the legislature or the executive was not functioning properly, it was for the people to correct the defects by exercising their franchise properly in the next elections and voting for candidates who would fulfil their expectations or by other lawful methods, e.g., peaceful demonstrations.</p></li><li><p><strong>“The remedy is not in the judiciary taking over the legislative or the executive functions, because that will not only violate the delicate balance of power enshrined in the Constitution but also (because) the judiciary has neither the expertise nor the resources to perform these functions.”</strong></p></li><li><p>The Bench said: <strong>“Judicial restraint is consistent with and complementary to the balance of power among the three independent branches of the state. It accomplishes this in two ways: first, judicial restraint not only recognises the equality of the other two branches with the judiciary, it also fosters that equality by minimising inter-branch interference by the judiciary. Second, judicial restraint tends to protect the independence of the judiciary. When courts encroach on the legislative or administrative fields almost inevitably voters, legislators, and other elected officials will conclude that the activities of judges should be closely monitored.”</strong></p></li></ol><h3>Public Interest Litigation</h3><p>The concept of <strong>Public Interest Litigation (PIL)</strong> originated and developed in the <strong>USA</strong> in the 1960s. In the USA, it was designed to provide legal representation to previously unrepresented groups and interests. It was undertaken in recognition of the fact that the ordinary marketplace for legal services fails to provide such services to significant segments of the population and to significant interests. Such groups and interests include the poor, environmentalists, consumers, racial and ethnic minorities, and others.</p><p>In India, PIL is a product of the judicial activism role of the <strong>Supreme Court</strong>. It was introduced in the early 1980s. <strong>Justice V.R. Krishna Iyer</strong> and <strong>Justice P.N. Bhagwati</strong> were the pioneers of the concept of PIL. PIL is also known variously as <strong>Social Action Litigation (SAL)</strong>, <strong>Social Interest Litigation (SIL)</strong>, and <strong>Class Action Litigation (CAL)</strong>.</p><h3>Meaning of PIL</h3><p>The introduction of PIL in India was facilitated by the relaxation of the traditional rule of <strong>‘locus standi’</strong>. According to this rule, only that person whose rights are infringed alone can move the court for remedies, whereas, PIL is an exception to this traditional rule. Under PIL, any public-spirited citizen or a social organisation can move the court for the enforcement of the rights of any person or group of persons who, because of their poverty, ignorance, or socially or economically disadvantaged position, are themselves unable to approach the court for remedies. Thus, in a PIL, any member of the public having <strong>‘sufficient interest’</strong> can approach the court for enforcing the rights of other persons and redressal of a common grievance.</p><p>The <strong>Supreme Court</strong> has defined PIL as:</p><blockquote><p>"A legal action initiated in a court of law for the enforcement of public interest or general interest in which the public or a class of the community have pecuniary interest or some interest by which their legal rights or liabilities are affected."</p></blockquote><p>PIL is absolutely necessary for maintaining the <strong>rule of law</strong>, furthering the cause of <strong>justice</strong>, and accelerating the pace of realisation of the <strong>constitutional objectives</strong>. In other words, the real purposes of PIL are:</p><ol><li><strong>Vindication of the rule of law</strong></li><li><strong>Facilitating effective access to justice</strong> to the socially and economically weaker sections of society</li><li><strong>Meaningful realisation of the fundamental rights</strong></li></ol><h3>Features of PIL</h3><p>The various features of <strong>Public Interest Litigation (PIL)</strong> are explained below:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Strategic Arm of Legal Aid Movement</strong>:</p><ul><li>PIL is intended to bring justice within the reach of the poor masses, who constitute the low visibility area of humanity.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Different from Ordinary Traditional Litigation</strong>:</p><ul><li>PIL is a different kind of litigation from ordinary traditional litigation, which is essentially of an adversary character where there is a dispute between two litigating parties, one making claims seeking relief against the other and that other opposing such claim or resisting such relief.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Promotion and Vindication of Public Interest</strong>:</p><ul><li>PIL is brought before the court not for the purpose of enforcing the right of one individual against another as happens in the case of ordinary litigation, but it is intended to promote and vindicate public interest.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Addressing Violations of Rights</strong>:</p><ul><li>PIL demands that violations of constitutional and legal rights of large numbers of people who are poor, ignorant, or in a socially or economically disadvantaged position should not go unnoticed and unredressed.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Co-operative Effort</strong>:</p><ul><li>PIL is essentially a co-operative effort on the part of the petitioner, the State or Public Authority, and the Court to secure observance of the constitutional or legal rights, benefits, and privileges conferred upon the vulnerable sections of the community and to reach social justice to them.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Redressing Public Injury</strong>:</p><ul><li>In PIL, litigation is undertaken for the purpose of redressing public injury, enforcing public duty, protecting social, collective, diffused rights and interests, or vindicating public interest.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Assertive Role of the Court</strong>:</p><ul><li>In PIL, the role held by the Court is more assertive than in traditional actions; it is creative rather than passive, and it assumes a more positive attitude in determining acts.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Flexibility of Procedure</strong>:</p><ul><li>Though in PIL the court enjoys a degree of flexibility unknown to the trial of traditional private law litigations, whatever the procedure adopted by the court, it must be procedure known to judicial tenets and characteristics of a judicial proceeding.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>No Determination of Individual Rights</strong>:</p><ul><li>In a PIL, unlike traditional dispute resolution mechanisms, there is no determination or adjudication of individual rights.</li></ul></li></ol><h3>Scope of PIL</h3><p>In 1998, the <strong>Supreme Court</strong> formulated a set of guidelines to be followed for entertaining letters or petitions received by it as <strong>Public Interest Litigation (PIL)</strong>. These guidelines were modified in <strong>1993</strong> and <strong>2003</strong>. According to them, the letters or petitions falling under the following categories alone will ordinarily be entertained as PIL:</p><ol><li><strong>Bonded Labour Matters</strong></li><li><strong>Neglected Children</strong></li><li><strong>Non-payment of Minimum Wages</strong> to workers and exploitation of casual workers and complaints of violation of Labour Laws (except in individual cases)</li><li><strong>Petitions from Jails</strong> complaining of harassment, for premature release and seeking release after having completed 14 years in jail, death in jail, transfer, release on personal bond, speedy trial as a fundamental right</li><li><strong>Petitions against Police</strong> for refusing to register a case, harassment by police, and death in police custody</li><li><strong>Petitions against Atrocities on Women</strong>, in particular harassment of bride, bride-burning, rape, murder, kidnapping, etc.</li><li><strong>Petitions complaining of Harassment or Torture</strong> of villagers by co-villagers or by police from persons belonging to <strong>Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes</strong> and economically backward classes</li><li><strong>Petitions pertaining to Environmental Pollution</strong>, disturbance of ecological balance, drugs, food adulteration, maintenance of heritage and culture, antiques, forest and wildlife, and other matters of public importance</li><li><strong>Petitions from Riot-Victims</strong></li><li><strong>Family Pension</strong></li></ol><p>The cases falling under the following categories will not be entertained as PIL:</p><ol><li><strong>Landlord-Tenant Matters</strong></li><li><strong>Service Matters</strong> and those pertaining to <strong>pension and gratuity</strong></li><li><strong>Complaints against Central/State Government Departments</strong> and Local Bodies except those relating to item numbers (1) to (10) above</li><li><strong>Admission to Medical and Other Educational Institutions</strong></li><li><strong>Petitions for Early Hearing of Cases</strong> pending in High Courts and Subordinate Courts</li></ol><h3>Guidelines for Admitting PIL</h3><p><strong>Public Interest Litigation (PIL)</strong> has become an important tool in the administration of law, but it must not transform into "Publicity Interest Litigation," "Politics Interest Litigation," "Private Interest Litigation," "Paisa Interest Litigation," or "Middle-class Interest Litigation (MIL)." The <strong>Supreme Court</strong> emphasized:</p><blockquote><p>"PIL is not a pill or a panacea for all wrongs. It was essentially meant to protect basic human rights of the weak and the disadvantaged and was a procedure innovated where a public-spirited person files a petition on behalf of such persons who on account of poverty, helplessness, or economic and social disabilities could not approach the court for relief. There have been increasing instances of abuse of PIL. Therefore, there is a need to re-emphasise the parameters within which PIL can be resorted to by a petitioner and entertained by the court."</p></blockquote><p>The Supreme Court laid down the following guidelines for checking the misuse of PIL:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Encourage Genuine and Bona Fide PIL</strong>:</p><ul><li>The court must encourage genuine and bona fide PIL and effectively discourage and curb the PIL field for extraneous considerations.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Formulate Rules</strong>:</p><ul><li>Instead of every individual judge devising their own procedure for dealing with PIL, it would be appropriate for each High Court to properly formulate rules for encouraging genuine PIL filed and discouraging PIL filed with oblique motives.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Verify Petitioner’s Credentials</strong>:</p><ul><li>The court should prima facie verify the credentials of the petitioner before entertaining the PIL.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Verify Petition’s Contents</strong>:</p><ul><li>The court shall be prima facie satisfied regarding the correctness of the contents of the petition before entertaining the PIL.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Substantial Public Interest</strong>:</p><ul><li>The court should be fully satisfied that substantial public interest is involved before entertaining the petition.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Priority of Petitions</strong>:</p><ul><li>The court should ensure that petitions involving larger public interest, gravity, and urgency must be given priority over other petitions.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Redressal of Genuine Public Harm</strong>:</p><ul><li>The court must ensure that the PIL aims at redressal of genuine public harm and public injury. The court should also ensure that there is no personal gain, private motive, or oblique motive behind filing PIL.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Discourage Frivolous Petitions</strong>:</p><ul><li>The court should discourage petitions filed by busybodies for extraneous and ulterior motives by imposing exemplary costs or adopting similar novel methods to curb frivolous petitions and those filed for extraneous considerations.</li></ul></li></ol>
