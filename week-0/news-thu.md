Heading: RBI approves ₹2.11 lakh crore dividend payout to govt for 2023-24

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on May 22 approved a ₹2.11 lakh crore dividend payout to the central government for 2023-24, more than double the amount it paid for the previous 2022-23 financial year.

The decision was taken at the 608th meeting of the Central Board of Directors of the Reserve Bank of India held under the chairmanship of Governor Shaktikanta Das.

"The Board...approved the transfer of ₹2,10,874 crore as surplus to the Central Government for the accounting year 2023-24," RBI said in a statement.

The dividend payout was ₹87,416 crore for 2022-23.

A Flourish chart

"With the revival in economic growth in FY 2022-23, the Contingent Risk Buffer (CRB) was increased to 6%. As the economy remains robust and resilient, the Board has decided to increase the CRB to 6.5% for FY 2023-24," the RBI said.

Analysts had expected a surplus transfer in the range of 750 billion rupees to 1.2 trillion rupees, aided by strong foreign exchange earnings.

The benchmark 10-year bond yield dropped four basis points to 7% after the announcement.

The board reviewed the global and domestic economic scenario, including risks to the outlook, the statement added.


### [‘Cambodia, Myanmar, Laos emerge hub of organised financial crimes targeting Indians’](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cambodia-myanmar-laos-emerge-hub-of-organised-financial-crimes-targeting-indians/article68204329.ece) | 2024-05-22
Heading: ‘Cambodia, Myanmar, Laos emerge hub of organised financial crimes targeting Indians’

Nearly half of financial frauds targeting Indians are originating from the three south-east Asian countries of Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos, and many web applications used to commit the frauds are written in Chinese language, thereby not ruling out the Chinese connection, Rajesh Kumar, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C), said on May 22.

Mr. Kumar said in the first four months of the year, Indians had lost over ₹1,776 crore in 89,054 cases of financial crimes such as digital arrest, stock market scam, investment scam and romance or dating scam and there had been a “spurt in the organised crime from south-east Asia.” These complaints were received on national cyber crime portal — cybercrime.gov.in and 1930 helpline, and not all of them were converted into First Information Reports (FIR).

With the effort of I4C and State police, a total of 3.25 lakh mule bank accounts, 595 apps and more than 3,000 URLs had been blocked in the past four months. Additionally, 5.3 lakh SIM cards, 80,848 IMEI numbers had been suspended since July 2023 and 3,401 WhatsApp groups had been taken down in the past two months.

He said financial crime hotspots remained active in India, but the quantum of money lost to south-east Asia origin frauds was much more.

Around 1,000 held

“Out of the total complaints on the portal, 85% complaints pertain to financial crimes, out of which 48% originate from south-east Asia. The financial crime hotspots in Jharkhand, Haryana, Rajasthan and West Bengal were still active and are expanding. Around 1,000 people have been arrested since December 2023,” Mr. Kumar said.

The government had identified “scam compounds” in these countries which resembled call centres. Fraudsters, including a large number from India, make calls to unsuspecting people in the country from Indian mobile phone numbers and dupe money through various methods.

“Out of the total financial scams originating from south-east Asia, the maximum number of complaints — 62,687 were related to investment scam. It lures people mainly through social media. The victim is told to sit at home and earn money. Generally it starts with earning money and later the victims end up losing a large amount. In 2023, we had more than 1 lakh complaints, and 10,000 FIRs were published,” Mr. Kumar said.

Mr. Kumar said that according to open-source information, China was also a victim of such scams and in one spell in the past two years, 44,000 Chinese people were brought back from the “scam compounds.”

“Many of the apps that we have seen being used are written in Chinese, therefore we cannot rule out the Chinese connection,” he said.

Protest against employers

The officer added that on May 20, many Indians working in a suspected scam compound in Sihanouk city, Cambodia protested against their employers. “Some of them join willingly and some are duped into joining these centres with the fake promise of data entry operator. They arrive on tourist visas in Thailand and due to ungoverned border and human traffickers, they end up in these compounds where they are made to work for long hours. The Indians erupted in protest as they wanted their passports back, the Andhra Pradesh police are investigating the case and three recruiting agents have been arrested,” Mr. Kumar said.

In the past four months, 360 Indians had been brought back from these compounds and 60 others were in the custody of the Indian Embassy.

“We have a list of all the people, including women, who have gone to this geography on tourist visas and have not returned for a very long time. Most are in the 21-30 age-group. We are seeking the help of the Ministry of External Affairs ### [MEA] to trace these people,” Mr. Kumar said.

He said the newly enacted Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), which would come into effect from July 1, would put such crimes in the “organised crime” category.

“There are people who are renting out their accounts to such fraudsters, then there are a large number of mule bank accounts which are being used to deposit the money cheated by the people. For every five mule bank accounts, two are in private and three are with public sector banks. Even the payment made for advertisements on Google luring people to frauds are made from Indian accounts. Google is making money. In collaboration with the platform, we are devising a machine-based solution,” he said.

On May 16, a high-level inter-ministerial committee headed by the Special Secretary (Internal Security) has been constituted aimed at mitigating cybercrime originating from south-east Asia targeting India.

### [No legal mandate to share voter turnout with anyone other than candidates and their agents, EC tells Supreme Court](https://www.thehindu.com/elections/no-legal-mandate-to-share-voter-turnout-with-anyone-other-than-candidates-and-their-agents-ec-tells-supreme-court/article68205044.ece) | 2024-05-22
Heading: No legal mandate to share voter turnout with anyone other than candidates and their agents, EC tells Supreme Court

The Election Commission (EC) on Wednesday told the Supreme Court that there was no “legal mandate” to provide the voter turnout data to any person other than electoral candidates or his agents.

“There is no legal mandate to provide the Form 17C ### [account of votes recorded] to any other person other than the candidate or his agent,” the EC said in a 225-page affidavit.

The poll body was responding to an application filed by the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), represented by advocates Prashant Bhushan, Neha Rathi and Cheryl D’Souza, primarily seeking to disclose authenticated record of voter turnout by uploading on the EC website scanned legible copies of Form 17C of all polling stations after each phase of polling in the General Elections 2024.

The NGO had alleged an inordinate delay in publishing voter turnout details followed by a sharp spike in figures from the initial voter turnout percentages released by the EC. The development, according to the ADR, had rung alarm bells about the authenticity of the polling data available in the public domain and raised suspicions whether the electronic voting machines (EVMs) were switched.

In the previous hearing on May 17, the Supreme Court had asked why the EC could not upload voter turnout details.

However, the EC countered in its affidavit that the ADR was merely trying to “create an entitlement in the middle of the election period”.

‘Voluntary initiative’

It said the statutory mandate required Form 17C to be shared only with candidates and their agents. However, it was the EC’s voluntary and “non-statutory” initiative to disclose the voter turnout through voter turnout app, website and various press releases.

“As a measure of voluntary disclosure, the information is published in the app continuously at two-hour intervals on polling day to reflect the live turnout data. Two press notes are issued on poll date. The last being at 11.45 p.m. after waiting for the maximum number of polling parties to return… This was an initiative for transparency at a national level as prior to the app, information was gleaned in a decentralised manner from returning parties, polling agents, sector magistrates and such sources. Press and TV channels used to do their own backend evaluations to project larger trends,” the EC, represented by senior advocate Maninder Singh and advocate Amit Sharma, explained.

The EC said the ADR had failed to appreciate the fact that publication of voter turnout data on its app was merely facilitative. The NGO had ignored the disclaimer that figures in the “non-statutory Voter Turnout App” were secondary and provisional data.

“Tentative figures from a secondary source can never be the final turnout figure,” the affidavit said.

Besides, some polling stations are situated in far-flung places. EVMs and accounts of votes recorded have to be transported or brought to the Returning Officer’s base offices. This would take time.

‘Mala fide campaign’

The EC said the application was part of a “consistent mala fide campaign to raise doubts against the EC in every possible way by voicing misleading allegations”.

The poll body said the objective of “certain elements” or “vested interests” was to revert to paper ballots by generating an unwarranted atmosphere of suspicion in close proximity to an election.

The EC accused the ADR of suppressing the information that the Supreme Court had upheld the EVM system in a judgment on April 26. The issue of Form 17C and its various aspects had been discussed in that case, the commission argued.

The EC said the General Elections were entering in last two phases and had so far been held smoothly. It was settled law that petitions intended to create suspicion in public minds or impede the conduct of the process and conclusion of elections by the EC ought to be rejected at the threshold itself.

### [BIMSTEC acquires ‘legal personality’ after charter comes into force](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bimstec-acquires-legal-personality-after-charter-comes-into-force/article68204638.ece) | 2024-05-22

Heading: BIMSTEC acquires ‘legal personality’ after charter comes into force

The Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) will now be open to new members and observers after a historic first charter of the grouping came into force on 20 May, the Ministry of External Affairs has announced. With the coming into force of the charter which was adopted in the 5th summit of the BIMSTEC leaders, the grouping has acquired a ‘legal personality’ and will be able to enter into structured diplomatic dialogue with other groupings and countries.

“The entry into force of the BIMSTEC Charter reaffirms India’s commitment to a prosperous, peaceful and sustainable neighbourhood. It is achieved by building on our shared history, culture, vision and mutual respect for each other. BIMSTEC reflects the synthesis of our Neighbourhood First and Act East policies,” said External Affairs Minister Dr. S. Jaishankar. Official Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal further elaborated and said, the coming into force of the charter will provide “legal and institutional framework for meaningful cooperation and deeper integration of the Bay of Bengal region.”

BIMSTEC was formed in 1997 but for a long time, the organization could not form consensus among its seven member states – Bangladesh, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Thailand, Myanmar and India – about a common charter that could sum up the vision of the grouping. Following the pandemic, the leaders of the BIMSTEC nations met virtually on 30 March 2022 under the chairship of Sri Lanka and adopted the charter. The chair of BIMSTEC was taken up by Thailand after the 5th leaders’ summit. Last month, Nepal’s partliament took up the BIMSTEC charter and ratified it which paved the way for the coming into force of chater.

The organization received greater attention especially in the backdrop of the near moribund status of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) which last time met in Kathmandu during November 2014. The next SAARC summit was scheduled to be held in Islamabad in 2016 but was derailed in the backdrop of terror strikes on India that New Delhi blamed on Pakistan-based elements. Ever since, the statements emanating from the Government of Prime Minister Modi have indicated that India is willing to shift its focus from SAARC to BIMSTEC as the latter is in greater harmony with India’s ‘Act East’ policy. This SAARC vs BIMSTEC issue came up during the debate in the parliament in Kathmandu where foreign minister of Nepal Narayan Kaji Shreshtha said that Nepal does not view BIMSTEC as a replacement of SAARC saying, “In order to reinvigorate the stalled SAARC process, Nepal, as its current chair, will surely take an initiative.”

In the previous decades, apart from the lack of a common charter, BIMSTEC was also marked by growing discord between Bangladesh and Myanmar which has displaced more than a million Rohingya refugees who entered Bangladesh in 2017. Similar refugees from Myanmar have also streamed into Thailand ever since the February 2021 coup. Following the coming into force of the charter on 20 May, the Ministry of External Affairs said, “The BIMSTEC Charter is a testament to the shared commitment of the Member States to promote regional cooperation in key sectors such as security, connectivity, trade, agriculture, environment, science and technology, agriculture and people to people contact.”


### [The value of attributing extreme events to climate change | Explained  ](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/the-value-of-attributing-extreme-events-to-climate-change-explained/article68189310.ece) | 2024-05-18

Heading: The value of attributing extreme events to climate change | Explained  

Just a couple of decades ago, the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) argued that individual weather events could not be attributed to climate change. The science has since evolved, albeit with all its attendant uncertainties, and now we regularly hear of researchers having been able to attribute some individual extreme events to climate change.

Many scientific and data challenges persist in this exercise even as its outcomes are argued to be usable for estimating richer countries’ historic liability of climate-related ‘loss and damage’ and the legal liability of governments and corporations in precipitating adverse events like floods and droughts. However, researchers have used a variety of methods to evaluate attributability, which raises questions about whether attribution science is mature enough to be used in courts and multilateral fora.

What is the value of extreme-event attribution?

While no formal cost-benefit analysis of an attribution exercise has been reported, many experts have argued that attributions are critical for the ‘loss and damage’ (L&D) process. L&D doesn’t have a unique definition but its place in climate talks under the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change has come a long way in the last decade. Economically developing countries, in particular those that are ‘particularly vulnerable’, have demanded the L&D fund to pay for the havoc climate change wreaks within their borders. Obviously, the criteria by which ‘particularly vulnerable’ countries are to be identified are crucial.

For example, India is a developing country in the tropics and is highly vulnerable to climate change’s impacts. But it is unlikely that India will qualify for L&D funding, and herein lies the rub: should climate finance and green funds focus on adaptation and mitigation alone or should they administer L&D funds separately? If the latter, then will attribution exercises help? The developed world is opposed to the idea of being held legally accountable in a court for any extreme events since that could open a floodgate of lawsuits.

Against this background, our understanding of whether attribution reports can actually hold up in court as evidence of culpability is very important. A good case in point is a recently published report on heatwaves in Asia.

How were the Asian heatwaves attributed?

Last week, a team of climate scientists called World Weather Attribution (WWA) reported that heatwaves across Asia, from the west to the southeast, had been rendered nearly 45-times more likely by climate change.

It is worth understanding how these ‘rapid extreme event attributions’ are performed. The most important concept is the change in probability: in this case, the climate scientists contrasted the conditions in which the heatwaves occurred against a counterfactual world in which climate change did not happen. The conditions that prevail in the counterfactual world depend on the availability of data from our world. When there isn’t enough data, the researchers run models for the planet’s climate without increasing greenhouse gas emissions and other anthropogenic forcings. Where there was sufficient data, they use trends in the data to compare conditions today with a period from the past in which human effects on the planet were relatively minimal.

This said, the data are hardly ever sufficient, especially for rainfall, and almost never for extreme rainfall events. Climate models are also notoriously bad at properly capturing normal rainfall and worse at extreme ones. Thus, climate scientists need to address these challenges in the process of assigning probability changes to events in the past. The climate models are better at capturing temperatures and temperature-related events — but again, only at regional scales, not at very local scales.

If, some day, climate scientists are able to perform reliable hyperlocal attribution exercises, they will still be confronted by a moral question: what actions should follow? Because right now, even though the L&D fund and climate jurisprudence are becoming more visible, attribution exercises are happening as if disconnected from governments’ adaptation and mitigation strategies.

Put another way: will people and businesses move away if a place is seen as being a hotspot of extreme events? This is not just a question of science. Governments need to be able to respond to such decisions, and attribution science should in turn be sufficiently reliable.

How do scientists pick extreme events to attribute?

Another significant challenge in attribution exercises is how scientists choose the extreme events for which they will perform attribution exercises.

When evaluating the Asian heatwaves, the WWA scientists used regional scales and different definitions for different regions. They also arbitrarily considered daily, three-day or monthly average temperatures for attributing likelihoods.

Heatwaves can be exacerbated by natural factors such as an El Niño event or human factors like urbanisation and deforestation. There is also a debate as to whether irrigation affects heatwaves as well.

Further, no weather event will occur in exactly the same form twice in a place, which means an extreme event occurring in that place will likely have no precedent. This is why it is easier to reliably attribute heatwaves at the subcontinent scale but not those at the level of particular areas.

The kind of questions that climate scientists ask also matters. For example, the same analysis can produce different answers to the questions “was the intensity of a heatwave amplified by climate change?” and “was the frequency or return period of a heatwave altered by climate change?”. In the WWA report, the scientists used multiple approaches in their attribution exercise to answer the same question, and have added that the differences between them are immaterial. It is not clear whether these differences will be perceived to be material in a court of law.

How do extreme events depend on human action?

The actual impacts of extreme events depend not only on the hazard or the extreme event but also on the vulnerability and the exposure of the population affected. Similarly, the financial consequences are also affected by multiple factors. So, should an attribution exercise only focus on the hazard or should it consider the impacts as well?

This is not a trivial question, especially if L&D negotiations are to be served reliably by attributions.

Considering all these challenges, we must take stock of the international finance aspects of adaptation, mitigation, and L&D. In particular, governments should consider an agreement on historical responsibilities to fund developing countries and close adaptation gaps, build adaptation capacity, and finance mitigation for the global good.

The real world is severely resource-constrained. In a counterfactual world, where human, financial, and computational resources are infinite, attribution exercises are a beautiful scientific challenge and could serve as a productive intellectual exercise. But in the real world, we need a cost-benefit analysis based on a clear role for attribution in the overall climate action landscape.

### [A ‘no-limit’ bromance that is not just a bilateral matter  ](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/a-no-limit-bromance-that-is-not-just-a-bilateral-matter/article68204733.ece) | 2024-05-23

Heading: A ‘no-limit’ bromance that is not just a bilateral matter  

Having met each other over 40 times in the past 11 years, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping are justified in calling each other “old friend”. Yet, their Summit in Beijing (May 16-17, 2024), ostensibly to mark the 75th anniversary of bilateral diplomatic relations, stands out, arguably, as among their most consequential meetings. Given their geostrategic and geoeconomic hefts, their “no-limit” bromance is not just a bilateral matter. It concerns the world at large including India, which has a significant yin-yang relationship with both.

The phases of Russia-China ties

Over the past two centuries, Russia-China relations have passed through at least five phases. During the 19th century, Czarist Russia took advantage of a weak China to expand to the Pacific, and the Soviet Union continued to hold these territories. A decade of “Comintern brotherhood” followed the establishment of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in 1949, but the bonhomie was upended by ideological and geopolitical differences, triggered, in part, by the Chinese attack on India, in 1962. Russia and China had armed clashes in 1969 over the Ussuri River border dispute.

After talks, ‘close friends’ Xi and Putin say China, Russia ties stabilising factor for world, conducive to peace

The fourth phase commenced in 1972, with United States President Richard Nixon’s dramatic visit to Beijing, aimed at weaning China from the Russia-led Eastern Bloc. In a paradigm shift, China tilted towards the West which supported Deng Xiaoping’s “four modernisations”, believing that “prosperity would make China a more liberal society”. Despite China’s violent suppression of the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, the West continued to lavish China with investments, technology transfer, market access and diplomatic support over the next three decades, transforming China into the “World’s Factory.” Meanwhile, Moscow-Beijing ties withered as the Soviet Union imploded and the Russian Federation, its successor, shed most of its Central Asian Republics which became an arena for geo-political competition with China.

The current phase began in 2012, when China’s growing assertiveness alarmed the U.S. into launching a “pivot Asia”, unveiling hard-lined policies to stem China’s rise and gradual economic decoupling. Growing friction with the West led China to return to Russia and the two famously declared after the Beijing Summit in February 2022 that their ties had “No Limits”. Within weeks, Mr. Putin launched a “limited military operation” against Ukraine. The West responded angrily with hundreds of sanctions on Moscow to cripple Russia economically. This western blockade impelled Moscow further towards China which was also under economic pressure from the same quarters. Over the past two years, their convergence against the West has triggered a quantitative and qualitative surge in Russia-China ties. Their trade reached $240 billion in 2023, having grown 26% over 2022. Russia is now predominantly dependent on China as a market for its energy exports and a source of critical inputs, such as sanctioned items and those required to pursue its Ukraine war. Russia was the largest crude supplier to China with volume averaging 2.1 million barrels a day in 2023. However, despite decoupling attempts, China traded $575 billion with the U.S. in 2023, more than twice its trade with Russia. In comparison, India’s 2023-24 annual trade with the U.S. and China was $118 billion each; it traded $66 billion with Russia.

The message in the joint statement

Against this backdrop, the 7,000-word Joint Statement issued after the Putin-Xi Summit was conspicuously silent on bilateral economic, financial and military ties. This taciturnity could have one of two diametrically opposite motives: it was either to avoid invoking western opprobrium and sanctions or to paper over their mutual disagreement. It is relevant to note that during a Beijing visit in April, U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken met President Xi to reportedly warn against helping Russia militarily. The joint statement also omits any India-specific issues, including the United Nations reforms, and confines treatment of Europe to a sanitised version of the Ukraine conflict.

Blinken back in China seeking pressure but also stability

China is boosting Russia’s war machine in Ukraine, says U.S.

In contrast, the text reserves the choicest invectives for the U.S., accusing it of pursuing “dual containment” (of both Russia and China, calling it “unconstructive and hostile”) and an “Indo-Pacific Strategy” with “a negative impact on the peace and stability of the region”. With its stark polarity, the Joint Statement is a clear sign that the two strategic partners have gone on an anti-U.S. offensive.

The Beijing Summit’s likely impact needs analysis in both the short and long terms. In the short run, it may lead to intensified, albeit understated, bilateral cooperation, particularly in the supply of the dual-use materials needed by Russia for its Ukraine campaign. In return, China may seek better terms for Russian raw materials, mining rights in Siberia and access to Russian know-how on a range of critical technologies such as avionics, nuclear power and space. China may also seek greater Russian acquiescence for its dominance over Central Asia.

Beijing may even have cynical motives for quietly supporting Russia: the continuation of the Ukraine war keeps a beleaguered Russia dependent on China and the U.S. preoccupied with eastern Europe, giving China the freedom to bully Asia.

In the longer run, the summit may have an even more profound fallout. While China would want to continue its profitable economic engagements with both Russia and the West, the inherent contradictions may eventually make this pursuit untenable.

On May 17, the U.S. State Department spokesman curtly told China, “You cannot have it both ways.” The continued western pressure may force it to play the Russian card in a high-stakes global poker. This, coupled with the Middle Kingdom’s incessant quest for global dominance, could usher in a new Cold War aimed mostly at creating a credible alternative to the U.S.-dominated post-Second World War global eco-political architecture. The early contours of the incipient China-driven global construct, such as BRICS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, the 109-member Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the 147-country, $1 trillion outlay Belt and Road Initiative are already in place and just need ramping up. It could thus presage the opening overture of a new global polarisation.

The impact on India

The Beijing Summit would have far-reaching implications for India, presenting it with both challenges and opportunities. To begin with, India needs to carefully and objectively examine the depth and durability of the current phase of the ties between Russia and China, given their erratic past. Both have strong leaders, even as Russia’s GDP is currently less than one-seventh of China’s. This coupled with the Ukraine war and the sanctions makes Moscow less than an equal partner, perhaps for the first time in their bilateral history. Moscow’s potential vulnerability to China’s hegemony could concern India given its still overwhelming dependence on Russia for defence supplies particularly as it has border tensions with China. India being Russia’s largest defence market, Moscow has an interest in retaining it. However, the reliability of Russian supplies may become subject to Chinese pressures.

While India has several reservations about the existing global architecture, it is by no means certain that Beijing’s alternative would suit India better. New Delhi’s best bet would perhaps be to press for a higher profile in the existing global order commensurate with India’s size and potential.

In retrospect, during the last Cold War, India largely pursued the high moral ground often eschewing its core national interests. Instead of focusing on its socio-economic development and the realpolitik it required, it adopted a doctrinaire approach to Non-Alignment and Third World solidarity. The rest is history and those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it.

The incoming global polarisation is likely to be differently nuanced with greater flux, driven mostly by the geo-economics and quest for new technologies. Unlike the first Cold War, India is now a major global player with hard-earned “strategic autonomy” providing it with real options. India should leverage its strengths judiciously, and adopt a sharper and nimbler approach. As new opportunities dawn, it needs to be clear-headed about its core long-term national goals, adopt a commensurate strategy and pursue it with single-mindedness.

### [A vegetable triumvirate, inflation and the takeaway PREMIUM](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/a-vegetable-triumvirate-inflation-and-the-takeaway/article68204706.ece) | 2024-05-23
Heading: A vegetable triumvirate, inflation and the takeaway  

Inflation is a critical indicator of an economy’s health, reflecting the changes in the general price level and the cost of living. In India, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is used to measure price inflation which is largely based on the Laspeyre’s price index and measures the economy’s cost of living. The CPI basket comprises 299 items of which vegetables account for a weight of 6.04% in the total basket.

Within vegetables, the three vegetables — tomato, onion, and potato (TOP) — hold a weightage of 2.2% in the overall CPI basket for an average Indian household. The significance of TOP goes beyond its numerical representation. These three commodities have historically played a pivotal role in influencing both food and beverages inflation as well as headline CPI figures. One notable fact is that the TOP group constitutes 3.6% of the total consumption basket in urban areas while it constitutes 5% of the total consumption basket in rural India for the bottom 5% of the consumption classes, respectively, as per the CPI basket classification.

In FY2023-24, vegetable prices in India soared by about 15% (year-on-year). Vegetable prices have exhibited significant volatility, shifting dramatically from a fall of 0.7% in June to a substantial rise of 37.4% in July. Though vegetables have a weight of only 6% in the total CPI basket, their contribution to inflation was as high as about 30% in February and March 2024. Tomato prices soared by 202% in July 2023 and contributed to 18.1% of the total headline inflation despite the weight of tomatoes being only 0.6% in the CPI basket. During the same month, the contribution of vegetables to headline inflation was a high 31.9%, and of TOP was 17.2%.

Price volatility

One of the striking features of TOP is its price volatility (chart). The coefficient of variation (CoV) of inflation is a key measure of volatility. The inflation volatility of TOP has been measured using the coefficient of variation (CoV) for the period January 2015 to March 2024, yielding a value of 5.2. It is significantly higher than the volatility of the vegetables sub-group (CoV=3.0), the food group (CoV=0.6) as well as the volatility of headline inflation (CoV=0.3). This exercise reveals that TOP’s CoV surpasses not only the food and headline group but also the vegetables sub-group. This heightened volatility underscores the sensitivity of these commodities to market forces, weather fluctuations, and supply chain dynamics.

The chart shows the inflation trend for the three commodities, i.e., tomato, onion and potato, as well as for the constructed TOP group. The inflation rate for the TOP sub-group has remained quite volatile ranging from a minimum value of -36.6% in September 2021 to 132.0% in December 2019 (The writer’s calculation uses data from the National Statistical Office).

Aiding the farmer

The volatility and importance of TOP in shaping inflation trends highlight the need for effective policy interventions and a nuanced understanding of agricultural supply chains. These are perishable crops and are subject to a number of biotic and abiotic stresses. As these crops do not have Minimum Support Price and are mostly sold to private traders by farmers, this volatility in prices also hurts farmers, the majority of whom are net buyers of these crops. The possible solutions to reduce the volatility of inflation for these crops include an overhauling of agricultural value chains and improvement in the cold storage facilities, better prices for farmers to incentivise the production of the crops, and increased profitability in the cultivation that can be achieved by reducing the exorbitantly high input prices of fertilizers and pesticides used in the production of these crops.

The abrupt changes in lifting the export bans on onion ahead of the Maharashtra elections also show that we are still using short-term measures to deal with the price volatility in these crops as against measures that are demanded by the farmers. The memorable Kisan Long March from Nashik to Mumbai in March 2023 and continuous protests by farmers have time and again raised the demand for Minimum Support Prices for onion.

Heading: Why are concerns being raised over the Election Commission’s voter turnout data? | Explained  

The story so far: The Supreme Court is slated to hear on May 24 a petition filed by the NGO Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) seeking a direction to the Election Commission of India (ECI) to upload polling station-wise voter turnout data on its website within 48 hours of the conclusion of polling for each phase of the Lok Sabha elections. Additionally, the NGO has flagged a sizeable difference in the initial turnout figures released by the ECI soon after the conclusion of polling and the final voter percentages published subsequently .

Such discrepancies have evoked sharp questions from the Opposition about the authenticity of the polling data available in the public domain, and the possibility of manipulation at the counting stage. On May 20, an intervention application was also moved in the case by advocate Mehmood Pracha who contested polls from the Rampur Lok Sabha constituency as an independent candidate. He alleged that the concerned returning officer (RO) had not furnished copies of the Form 17C record of votes polled in his constituency as mandated by the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961 (1961 Rules).

Echoing similar concerns, a group of civil society members and former bureaucrats have also written to the apex poll body, urging it to “immediately disclose” the authenticated record of voter turnout of every polling station — as contained in Part I of Form 17C (Account of votes recorded)— via the ECI website. “The inordinate delay in the release of voter turnout, coupled with the unusually high revision of nearly 6%  [in the first two phases] sans any explanation” has raised doubts over the voter turnout figures, the letter said.

Form 17C and its significance

As per the 1961 Rules, the ECI has to maintain two forms that have data on the number of electors and the votes polled — Forms 17A and 17C. While the former is used to record the details of every voter who comes into a polling booth and casts his or her vote, the latter is an account of all the votes recorded. Under Rule 49S(2), a presiding officer is mandated to furnish a copy of the entries made in Form 17C to the polling agents of the candidates at the close of polling.

Part I of Form 17C contains crucial information — the identification numbers of the EVMs used in the polling station, the total number of electors assigned to the polling station, the total number of voters as entered in the register for voters (Form 17A), the number of voters who decided not to record their votes after signing the register, the number of voters who were not allowed to vote, the total number of test votes and votes recorded per EVM. Part II of the same form contains the results of the counting carried out on the stipulated day.

The data in Form 17C is used by candidates to verify the results on counting day by matching it with the EVM count. Subsequently, an election petition can also be moved in the concerned High Court in case of any discrepancies.

Final polling data raises ‘serious doubts’

The ECI has come under scrutiny for not releasing the absolute number of votes polled in any constituency in this general election, unlike in 2019. Only voting percentages have been published, that too after significant delay — after 11 days of the first phase of polling held on April 19 and four days after the second phase of polling held on April 26.

On May 7, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge wrote to leaders of the INDIA bloc saying that the polling data released by the ECI “raises serious doubts.” He flagged that apart from the delay, the voter turnout data released by the ECI “does not mention crucial yet related figures, such as the votes polled in each Parliamentary Constituency and in the respective Assembly Constituencies.” He also alleged that the “credibility of the Election Commission” was at an all-time low.

“...On earlier occasions, the Commission has published voter turnout data within 24 hours of polling. What has changed this time? Why has the Commission failed to issue any clarification to justify the delay, despite being repeatedly questioned by political parties as well as political activists?”, Mr. Kharge asked. He also expressed concern that in his 52 years of electoral life, he had never witnessed such a high increment of voting percentages in the final published data.

The provisional polling percentages for the first phase released by the ECI at 7 pm on April 19 was about 60% and for the second phase on April 26 was 60.96%. However, the final figures released on April 30 for the first phase stood at 66.14% (an increase of more than 5.5%) and 66.71% for the second phase (an increase of more than 5.74%).

A Flourish chart

The Congress chief further questioned what was precluding the poll body from publishing the exact voter turnout data of each polling station when such information was already available with the polling agents of the candidates through Form 17C. Since no data had been released about the number of eligible voters (electors) in each parliamentary constituency, it was impossible to calculate whether the absolute number of voters had increased or decreased, Mr. Kharge said.

TMC leader Mahua Moitra, the Lok Sabha candidate for Bengal’s Krishnanagar constituency, also took to the social media platform X to highlight how she was able to compile the number of voters in her constituency within 24 hours of polling. She demanded to know why the ECI had failed to publish this exact information for the previous phases of polling.

‘No legal obligation’

In a scathing letter to Mr. Kharge, the ECI maintained that it has no legal obligation to furnish information about the absolute number of votes polled in every polling station to the general public.

“It may be noted that Commission is not legally bound to publish any voter turnout data at the aggregate level of a constituency, a State or in a phase of election because voter turnout is recorded at polling station level in statutory Form 17 C which is prepared by the presiding officer and signed by the polling agents of candidates present. Copies of Form 17 C are shared with polling agents present immediately, as the strongest measure of transparency. So, candidates are aware and in possession of exact voter turnout data in absolute numbers even before it is known to the ECI,” the letter stipulated.

Calling the allegations by Mr. Kharge an attempt to “create confusion, misdirection and impediments in the conduct of free and fair polls”, the poll body pointed out how voters continue to vote even after 6:00 pm due to long queues at polling stations resulting in variations in the estimated data on poll day. 

Notably, in an affidavit filed before the apex court, the ECI underscored that disclosure of data on the “Voter Turnout App” is a “voluntary” and “non-statutory” initiative intended for transparency and public facilitation. While pointing out that ADR had ignored the disclaimer that figures in the app were secondary and provisional data, it stressed that “tentative figures from a secondary source can never be the final turnout figure”.

The Court was also apprised that online disclosure of Form 17C data could cause “confusion in the minds of voters” since it would also include postal ballot counts. “Indiscriminate disclosure, public posting on the website increases the possibility of the images being morphed, including the counting results which then can create widespread public discomfort and mistrust in the entire electoral processes”, the Commission claimed.

Casting aspersions on ADR’s motive, the poll body said the plea was part of a “consistent mala fide campaign to raise doubts against the EC in every possible way by voicing misleading allegations”. The objective of “certain elements” or “vested interests” was to revert to paper ballots by generating an unwarranted atmosphere of suspicion in close proximity to an election, it alleged further. It also referred to ADR’s unsuccessful challenge in the EVM-VVPAT cross-verification case and claimed that the top Court had already discussed the issue of Form 17C and its various aspects.

ADR’s plea before top Court

ADR has sought the Supreme Court’s intervention to direct the ECI to upload online scanned copies of Part I of Form 17C for all polling stations within 48 hours of the close of polling. Saying that such information is “readily available” with the poll body, the NGO has also sought the publication of detailed constituency and polling station-wise turnout data in both absolute numbers and percentage form. 

“The inordinate delay in the release of final voter turnout data, coupled with the unusually high revision (of over 5%) in the EC press note of April 30 and the absence of disaggregated constituency and polling station figures in absolute numbers, has raised concerns and public suspicion regarding the correctness of the data… These apprehensions must be addressed and put to rest,” the petition said.

While seeking ECI’s response to the plea on May 17, Chief Justice of India (CJI) D.Y. Chandrachud, heading a three-judge Bench, asked the poll body’s counsel, “Every Polling Officer submits ### [voting records] by the evening, after 6 or 7 p.m., by which time the polling is completed. The Returning Officer would then have the data of the entire constituency. Why don’t you upload it?”

ADR has also pointed out that many times polling agents are not available at polling booths to obtain the Form 17C data which necessitates the publication of such crucial information online.

What do experts have to say?

“The ECI always discloses absolute numbers of voter turnouts. This time they are only disclosing percentages. Usually the turnouts are out within 24 hours of the end of polling unlike this time and the increase in voter turnout in the final figures is unusually high,” Anjali Bharadwaj, Director of Common Cause earlier told The Hindu. She added that the poll body should upload a scanned copy of Form 17C as soon as it is submitted by the Presiding Officer to abate transparency concerns.

Addressing the ECI’s assertion that access to Form 17C data by polling agents negates the need for such information to be published online, Jagdeep S. Chokkar, the founder of ADR, pointed out that political parties do not contest elections in all constituencies. “Does this mean that a party which is not contesting the election in a particular constituency, is not expected to have or should not have any interest in what happens in that particular constituency? This does not stand to reason,” he wrote in The Wire.

The renowned activist also highlighted how smaller political parties cannot afford to have polling agents in all booths or constituencies due to financial constraints. In fact, The Hindu found that since one constituency has roughly 2,000-2,200 booths, a candidate needs to have approximately 6,000 polling agents in each constituency to be able to obtain a copy of Form 17C. “This shows that it is impossible for smaller parties and many independents to have polling agents in all booths,” Congress Rajya Sabha MP Shakti Singh Gohil said.
